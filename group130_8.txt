<Text>The staff and my doctor at Foothill Optometric Center were all very friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. They appear to have all the modern equipment required for a thorough exam and the office is clean and has a large selection of frames. I appreciated the opinions of the person who helped me with frame styles. We chose a style very quickly and agreed on the most flattering look. My doctor was especially nice, informative, and professional. I'm new to this area so I'm very lucky to have found an optometry center I can trust for the rest of my life here.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Date>1620453618362<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>There was a long wait time and I had to go back the next day but they made sure I get a discount for the inconvenience. The clinic was clean and the doctor was superb. She went into detail and even gave me advice how to care for my eyes (not all doctors do unfortunately). The price was reasonable; they also sell the Draper James glasses but I did not get it since I was on a strict budget (I will buy it next time though). Overall, a wonderful clinic.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>They’re the only optometric center, in Rancho, that carry the Silhouette rimless eyewear.  They’re lightweight and classic.The inventory and professional staff is on point! Conformity to pandemic protocol is actively in place. Most customers like myself get their exams done where we find our frames.Thank you Foothill Optometry, for your wonderful range of inventory.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c34a3e78b293e1:0xd8e2600c9f93606</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Perfect! the staff were very friendly. They take advantage of multiple advanced equipment. And they are always happy to assist you by addressing your vision needs. They even helped me pick out a frame with great patience. Overall it was a great experience. I am willing to return anytime.< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Would give 0 stars if I could, very disappointed in my visit. Made an appointment to get a refill on my contacts which I  had run out of about 2- 3 weeks prior. First I had to wait 20 minutes before I  was called then the girl who called me started asking me if I  knew how much everything was going to cost. It seemed odd because I  never had that experience before at this office. I was informed it was going to cost me between $45.00 and $85.00 just to see the Dr. to get a refill on my contacts. Then she said I was required to take this other test which costs another $29.00. Which I do not need nor do I  want. I was asked twice before at previous appointments and it was not a requirement. It was not a good experience and the girl made me feel very uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that I left without seeing the Dr. and getting my refills. I  have given 5 stars at my previous visits. I have gladly recommended this office to family and friends. But no more. I  will be finding a new Optometrist office.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Text>My husband was seen by Dr. Jessica Mercado-Archambault who was very patient, smart, and caring. She really took her time to make sure his exam went as expected and he got the correct prescription. He was also seen by Dr.Suplee who rushed him and gave him an incorrect prescription, which ended up as huge inconvenience for us.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Foothill Optometry Center is the best! I received great care every time I come here.   The staff and doctors are very friendly,  caring and most importantly, they are very knowledgeable and professional . Dr Jessica Archambault  did a thorough and comprehensive  exam and took her time  in explaining the results. She answered all my questions in a pleasant manner. I left the office with peace of mind after Dr Archambault’s explanations about my eye health. Jenny’s helped is also appreciated. She made feel very comfortable in choosing the frame and she explained the breakdown of the payment. They have so many nice frames to chose from. I definitely recommend  this office!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I felt thoroughly taken care of here. I was so impressed and will keep coming back. I don’t have any major eye problems, I just like to make sure everything is healthy every year.. but I was made to feel like that was just as important. I also learned so much, and really trusted my assessment. Thank you for being so thorough and teaching me about my eyes!</review>

I just had an annual check up for glasses and contacts. The staff was kind, friendly and very efficient. Dr. Suplee is amazing and her energy is contagious. I was in and out in 50 min! I also appreciate the staff using a cancelation calling list to help me get in when I need to switch my appointments around and there aren’t any available. So helpful!</review>

I’ve been going here now for several years and have always found a professional and comfortable experience. No one pushes sales of glasses or add on services. They’ll take as much time as i want selecting frames and each doctor is helpful and informative, always ensuring all my questions are answered. Couldn’t ask for more.</review>

< Review>
I absolutely loved everything about this place. I took my 94 year old grandmother in for an eye exam and glasses. Everything was 100% covered by her insurance, including her coach glasses. The ladies in the office are all amazingly sweet and helpful. They do require masks and are taking Temps as you come in, but they are about as happy about it as you are. We definitely won't be going anywhere else for our eye needs in the future. I highly recommend them!<//Review>

Foothill Optometric Center does an excellent job for eye care! I have been a patient for 3 years and have found their service both efficient and thorough.  The annual exams include checking both the front and back of the eye followed by a consultation with the doctor to view the images on computer and discuss results.   Staff also advise on selection of frames from a wide range of choices, and perform cleaning & maintenance for glasses already owned.

I highly recommend Foothill Optometric Center for the entire family.<//review>

I always have a good experience coming here. I work nights and it’s always a chore to have to do things health wise. The doctors personality is unique and makes things fun. The staff is knowledgeable and able to help with options when you can’t decide on what pair of glasses you want. I wish I could take them all 😂 I live in riverside so it’s a bit of a drive and honestly wouldn’t go anywhere else!</review>

<text>Dr. Ashlee Suplee was amazing. She’s very thorough and gave us a referral letter for my daughter to be seen by neurologist right away, which  my pediatrician used to get us for the next day appointment with the neuro.  She’s not only concern of eye care but looks into possible problem. Thank you so much Dr Ashlee and all the staff!</text></record>

My experience with Foothill Optometric is ALWAYS A-plus!  My entire family and I have been coming here for years. I was so happy to see Dr Abo on my most recent and it is always a pleasure seeing his wife! I totally trust them with my vision care. Ally has been there for several years and she always greets me with a big smile and before the pandemic, a hug! They are all awesome!! Love this place! I could go on and on! If you are thinking of booking an appointment here, do it! You will be very pleased!< /text>

Krista and the Foothill O.C. Team are and have been absolutely AMAZING with every aspect of providing the best experience possible when it comes to the levels of service. I have had 6, yes 6 pairs of Spy frames w/prescription lenses done with them and each time feels more satisfying than the last. At the very least you owe it to yourself to give this place a visit and see for yourself ; )!< /text>

The high technology optometric center is so impressive. The lady assistants and the lady Doctor are so knowledgeable of their work. You get more that what you deserve. Not to mention that their fees are quite reasonable. Prices of their eyeglasses are too.< /Text>

I love foothill optometric, but they’ve definitely messed up here and there. Not going into much detail but I made an appointment to find new frames on July 11 first thing in the morning and I had to get up like if I were going to work. I get there and they tell me that my exam is coming up in October and that if I wanted to wait and use my insurance allowance till then in case my prescription changed drastically. I was mad in the moment but I’m not the type to make a scene. I left letting them know I’d come back in October, but they could’ve let me know when I made the appointment that I was coming up for an exam and we could’ve saved us a massive amount of time.< /text>

<response>{'time': 1594503638861, 'text': "Hi Martha,\n\nI am so sorry that we let you down.  I would be frustrated as well.  One option that I don't know if you were given, is that you can get your glasses now and schedule your appointment in October.  During your appointment the doctor can show you the difference in your prescription and you can decide if you would like the prescription updated to the new one.  We can send the glasses back to the laboratory within 3 months and have it changed to the new prescription at no charge to you.  The only problem is that you would have to wait for the glasses to come back again for the redo.\n\nWe really appreciate the feedback and we continue to work on issues when they arise.  As you mentioned, we are not perfect, but we really do try to improve.  We have weekly staff meetings that we work on situations that come up and see how we can avoid future problems.\n\nScheduling glasses orders is new for us, but definitely with these new procedures we are learning quickly to adapt and troubleshoot problems as they arise.\n\nWe do value your trust in our office and hopefully we can avoid any further issues.  If you have any questions or concerns please reach out to us.\n\nStay Safe and Healthy!\n\nTake Care,\n\nDr. Abo"}< /response></record></dataset><record>

I went to Foothill Optometrc Center today. As usual  everyone  was very courteous and professional.

Dr. Murakami is a wonderful, caring person. She is the best Optometrist I have ever had and I am 81 years old. She took  time to explain her findings and answered all my questions to my complete satisfaction.</text>

Fantastic staff and always super friendly and helpful. Been going here for years and will continue to do so. It's great to see the superb customer service happen continuously even over the years. You'll see business have a change of staff over the years and the customer service will change due to it, but not here.  Definitely would highly recommend.< /Review>

I love coming here. They have so many options for glasses and good prices. All the staff are very nice, welcoming, and friendly. I see Dr. Ashley Suplee and she is AMAZING!!! I wish more people had her kindness and personality. I will forever be coming back to Foothill Optometric Center.<//Review>

This was my second appointment. I love how thorough their exams are. The ladies at reception are very friendly. I’ve seen 2 different doctors there, and both were super warm and friendly. The optometrists are very helpful in making sure you find frames you like, and make the whole process go smoothly. I’ve loved my experiences thus far.<//text>

You cannot find a more friendlier and professional staff in SoCal. They use state-of-the-art optometric technology and have a very broad choice of eyewear for any one. I will not go anywhere else within the I.E. and have enjoyed their services for over 3 years.</review>

My family and I went in for eye appointments and saw Doctor Ashley Supple. Let me tell you she is informative, friendly, and does her job with  professionalism. If you want a good eye doctor who takes her time see this Doc you will not be disappointed and the eyeglass selection and working environment was a bonus.</Text>

<Review>I am so glad I found Foothill Optometric! Everyone who works there is so friendly.  I think I received a more thorough exam than anywhere else I've been, testing I'd never had before.  My husband and I had a great time picking out frames with Krista.    They have a great selection and I really appreciated her input.  If you're looking for a new eye doctor, you should give Foothill Optometric a try.  You won't regret it!!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Definitely not your routine eye exam. Every step was handled by an experienced eye care representative. Perfectly coordinated using state of the art technology. They also had many options within my budget which was  always a concern. Highly recommended< /Review>

From checking in at the front desk,  seeing the doctor, up until choosing your glasses and payment is all done with ease. Making an appointment is easy you will always get a remainder text and phone call. Everyone working at this office has amazing customer service and each employee is knowledgeable, friendly and ready to assist with any questions. You never feel rushed here. You can tell they enjoy their work and you can feel the positivity, team work and friendly atmosphere. All the optometrists are amazing but Dr.Suplee is amazing with the kiddos. My girls love going to see her. Giving this office anything less than 5 stars is crazy 😜. Oh and there’s a great selections of designer frames.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

My family and I have been going to Foothill Optometric for 16 years now. We drive down from Riverside, so that should tell you a lot. The Doctors are great and Erica and Ally (sorry if I spelled your names wrong). Are the best at helping us pick glasses that look good and not trying to get us to pick super expensive glasses. Don’t get me wrong, The other girls are good too. We have just been working with those 2 ladies the longest. Great selection and wonderful service.<//Text>

I love this center, the staff are very welcoming and make you feel at home  Dr Abo is wonderful at explaining and making sure details are clear to the ordinary layman. I feel very cared for and trust him implicitly.

< Review>
Walking in the door I was immediately greeted. I asked if they were taking any walk-ins, the receptionist replied that they were fully booked & would gladly set an appointment for the following morning. This is great start considering many places take in walk-ins even if they are too busy. Honesty is important. I know why they don’t overbook because I was given one to one service each step of the way & everything was explained to me in detail even what my insurance covered. I did not feel pressured into buying more than what I needed. Thank you to all the employees at Foothill Optometric Center!!!<//Review>

I absolutely LOVE this place! Dr. Suplee is simply the best. Extremely kind and patient and spends as much time as you need to discuss any concerns or any questions you have. I’ve never felt rushed or led to believe she or the staff didn’t care. I have a few medical conditions and see several Doctors and haven’t come across one as AMAZING as Dr. Suplee. The entire staff is incredible. I feel like family when I come in. Completely recommend them to everyone I can.<//Text>

Cant tell you enough great things about this place! From walking in the door and the girls behind the counter always remembering who you are- to Dr Suplee being such a caring and wonderful doctor. She truly gets to know you and makes sure all your questions are answered and walks you through every step of your exam to your fittings! I will never go anywhere else!<//Text>

My eye Dr. for YEARS! I have been coming here for years. They throughly understand and care about the health and comfort of my eyes.   Great customer service and never make you feel like "just a customer ". Even though I pass approximately 10+ Optometrist offices coming here, I'll continue to take the trip!< /review>

I've been going to Foothill Optometric for a couple of years now and they are the best. I've experienced some vision issues in the past and ever since I've been seeing Dr. Abo everything is great. He takes his time and explains everything to you and he really cares about his patients. I will never go to another optometrist besides the team of doctors at Foothill Optometric. The front office team is also amazing and they have excellent customer service and tons of designer frames and lenses for reasonable prices.</Text>

I have been coming to Foothill Optometric Center for quite a while now. I never have had any bad experience. All the staff in the front are all so nice, professional , and patient. They take their time assisting you to find the best frames that fits your face. All the doctors are also professional, knowledgeable, and kind. They have a large amount of frames to choose from.  I highly recommend this place to everyone.</review>

<Review>My experience was overall great with the exception of the non genuine, non smiling but very professional staff. The Dr. was amazing and thoroughly pleasant which made up for the visit but then......unsuccessful with finding the perfect frames so I was advised to go to LensCrafters. Extremely Satisfied....second pair of frames " Bingo " I take the frames back to Foothill Optometry for the associate to tell me they want be responsible for the frames. Kindly reminder that I wasn't informed of this important information.... Her reply! Oh, I did think you were going to buy any! Really! 🤔 But you advised me to go there! Apology accepted but a total inconvenience!</Review>< pics>

<review>My husband and I have been going to Foothill
Optometric Center for over 10 years.   I know, a little late giving a review!   Dr Abu is absolutely the most thorough optometrist I have ever gone to in my 70 years.   He noticed a change
In one of my eyes and sent me to an Opthomologist to be checked for a
newly developed glaucoma issue.      The office is modern and the staff is absolutely amazing.   I would give 10 stars if I could!    Everyone there makes sure you are
Comfortable and completely satisfied!!!!!< /review>< rate>

This was my third eye exam here, all with Dr Suplee, and as usual she was both professional and friendly. She took the time to detail the results of her specific eye tests as well as those administered by the technician (a very comprehensive battery of tests!).  And when she noted that one of the tests administered by the tech gave ambiguous results, she repeated a more specific version of it to clear things up and make sure there were no problems.

I was made to feel very comfortable by the friendly staff and Dr Suplee.  Of course, I will back again next year for my exam.</Text>

I have been coming to Foothill Optometric for 4 years and I've never had a bad experience. I appreciate the technology they use as an alternative to dilation.  The selection of eyewear is extensive work a variety of styles and brands.  The staff are always welcoming and able to assist.< /Text>

< Review>
Had been going to Foothill Optometric for a few years and decided to try another office.... mistake. Although the personnel were friendly their selection was horrible. Needless to say I'm back and would definitely recommend this office to anyone. Knowledgeable, friendly, and courteous. Great selection of glasses.</Review>

Process was pretty simple, felt like the prices were a little high but still not LensCrafters territory. All said and done, the experience was smooth.< /review>

To start with, they were
very friendly on the phone to set
my appointment.  I am so impressed by
their equipment. Even though I am given extensive tests, my
exam process was painless and fast. Dr.  Sjauw
is very professional and friendly. She answered all the questions
about my eye health.
For people who are looking for dedicated committed
doctors and concerned about their eye health, I would
highly recommend Dr.Sjauw  . From now on , I’ll
definitely go there for my routine eye exams.<//Text>

I had a terrific experience with Dr. Murakami. She was able to identify an issue with my prescription that I have had from other optometrists for the last few years that I didn't realize was causing issues with my near vision. She is friendly, personable, professional, and knowledgeable. The staff at the office were friendly, and I was shocked that they remembered my name when I came in a few days later to pick up a prescription. Highly recommend!< /text>

I've been there twice, once to purchase glasses and a year later for an exam, on both occasions the staff couldn't have been nicer, they were very helpful and accommodating, the Dr who did my exam, she was the absolute best, I've been wearing glasses for many years, Foothill Optometric Center has the best warranties on glasses and frames, also reasonable prices on designer frames.  I'm a fan and you will be too!</Review>

This place is great. The staff is very professional and friendly. To me, the front staff represents the entire business and the doctors - and this staff does not disappoint. I go to Dr. Murakami, and she is highly professional, yet personable. My whole family goes here.</review>

The staff was super friendly and helpful!!! DR.ABO really knows his stuff, and really gets in depth about your eyes and vision, you can tell he really loves what he does, he has a passion for a vision and it helps regular folks like myself really understand vision and the importance of taking care of your eyes! I came on a saturday around 2pm and they stayed after hours until i picked out my frames all in all this place is perfect, I will recommend to anyone!!!  keep up the wonderful work!<//Text>

PERMANENTLY CLOSED. See my review on Wojia Sechuan restaurant which is now at the same locartion.

CRAZY GOOD!  Try the combination Mao Cai.
It's not a soup!  It's not an entrée!  It's Both and BETTER. MIND BOGGLING GOODNESS.

EVEN BETTER! Take a look at this delicious bowl of traditional Szechuan Dan Dan noodles. With sauce underneath and a crumbly, and slightly oily pork peanut topping, this is heaven in a single bite. I cannot recommend this highly enough! See the new picture!<//Text>

<text>I would not say the food here is super nice, but good enough for me to come again. People usually order hot pot because they can have buffet for hot pot. Besides that, the entrees are also good. The whole fish, however, not as good as I expected, though it looks pretty delicious and tasty... The service is very good, you can simply ask for it if you need something. Anyway, if you are the first time to come there, you should definitely try hot pot!</text>< Pictures>

I can't believe that I forgot about V-Pot review until I passed by today. Nice spacious place with various seating and big fan of face masks. Waitress speak english and mandarin with a solid tone. No trouble understanding each other for sure. Wait time is not as long if they're five or less people. Proper utensils are provided, but if you need more just raised your hand. My bowl was spicy and hot. It's pretty good for the price, but I know there are better out there. Will try other items with colleagues on next schedule visit.</review>

If I can give this place a 0 star I would. This was one of the worst dining experiences ever. The waitresses and servers made it known that we were a burden to them. It wasn't busy only one other table was being occupied and were attended to often while we were ignored. They never gave us utensils even after asking repeatedly.<//text>

It's AYCE for a very good price and they are pretty generous with their servings too. Staff aren't the most friendly but would be considered good enough. I think they could be cleaner but it was alright for me.< /Text>

Overpriced for low selection and quality. Not much selection of sauce and taste was bad. Didn't have the most of meat on menu for all you can eat and never told me about it. And gave me so much vegetables at the beginning that I couldn't eat the much of the little meat they gave me.< /Text>

This store has always been awesome I donate there and as an asset protection associate at a nun named store I don't feel their policy about not having backpacks and profiling. When someone is willing to spend good money is judged by their appearance I do not do that at my company nor do my associates< /text>

Judgmental staff. I came out of work and visited goodwill to pass time due to a traffic jam and was followed around the whole time I'm assuming because of my dirty work clothes.</Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Given the times of Covid, I called to clarify that the store and donation center was open. The woman on the phone so the donations are open until 4 PM. I loaded up my car, and 20 minutes later at 3:25 PM I arrived, it was closed. I called back and the woman said they “just closed” and suggested I come earlier. It would help customers if this location is sure that hours both posted and shared via phone are accurate with the actual hours of operation.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808e20edbb87d05f:0x213cc1e8eee7be6b<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>The Morgan hill good will workers are lazy. They only except one 3x3 container full of items. I would rather throw my items in the trash then take them to the Morgan hill good will. Which is really safe because a lot of people could probably use these items. They say there open when they are not.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>The staff here are very nice and helpful. Every time I come, I see some type of Minion related thing, which is great. And Easy Bake ovens. Lots of them. The books are (mostly) good quality. It’s like they were never read. Some clothes are worth buying, but not that many. Everything is pretty cheap. Great parking. Love coming here, can’t wait until next time.< /Text><Rate>4<//Rate><pictures>None< /pictures><user>101582030349050815032< /user>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This is a nice big store which is well organized and clean. I was able to pick up a part for my computer here at a fraction of the price I would have had to pay at a computer parts website. Thank to the good people who make Goodwill work.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Such a bad goodwill store. Some staff are nice. But, some aren’t. One of them talked to me at such a heavy tone, that I didn’t like it at all. They could’ve talked to me more nicely or politely, but did it in where I think the employer didn’t have a good mood. They have a good selection of clothes. But, not really much merchandise. There is one store up north in Santa Teresita. Their stuff is actually good. I actually had real hopes for goodwill, but not anymore. Just by what they said, can really make you feel mad. But, I am cool tempered. Thanks goodwill.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

It's not a big store but during summer they have furniture for sale standing outside, behind the building which is good. But if you want to drop off your furniture, they sometimes take it, and other days they don't which is very frustrating if they send you away and you have to find another place to drop off your stuff.</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Very bad service friend got punched started to blead and all they said was to leave or they will call the cops. The "manager" escalated the situations by continuously tempting us and saying we were in the wrong like we provoked the employee. Employee was very unstable from the beginning and said was going to hit my friend in the face and them did.friend blead a lot on his t-shirt and floor and we where just helping him with a few other customers. Fat manager comes in with anger saying we where in the wrong even though we just talked.got ruder by the second even when we where being polite and just said we really didn't do anything wrong there employee did.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The worse, unhappy workers accepting my donation.  One worker was throwing the donated items breaking it.  The bossman was doing the same.  Unhappy lot of people working here.  Probably wishing they were drinking beer and smoking dope instead.</text>

(Translated by Google) They have fixed the ceilings are now higher in the air circulation they have also marked the floor to avoid bumping into the front and respect the 6 ft distance. And it seems important to me to keep it open because now we are taking things out and cleaning our closet that over time we fill up.

(Original)
Le an  hecho arreglos los techos ahora están mas altos  en la circulación del aire también han marcado el piso para no toparse de frente y respetar los 6 ft de distanciamiento. Y me párese importante que se mantenga abierto por que ahora estamos sacando cosas y limpieza de nuestro clóset que con el tiempo nos  llenamos.< /review>

I’d been having a terrible time with my work not knowing anything about how my union dues worked. Even my GM admitted she had no clue what was going on when I was receiving letters saying I hadn’t paid my dues.

I called in expecting this to be a nightmare of a process but Marlene made some genuinely complicated account navigating go by really smooth, and she was very patient and obviously invested in helping me get to the root of the problem. You really could not ask for more when it comes to these kinds of calls. Superb service, thank you Marlene & team.< /text>

Can’t say enough good things about UFCW 324! I want to point out that Marlene at UFCW 324 is always answering all my questions and concerns with patience and professionalism.   Being a full time employee and student I don’t have time to drive directly to the building sometimes. But Marlene has gone above and beyond to direct me to the necessary resources that expedite the forms I have to turn in. Thanks to Marlene my experience with UFCW 324 have been nothing less then amazing. Keep up the great work Marlene!<//text>

<review>Horrible waste of my hard earned money. This union only care for the companies they work under, like Albertsons, not for you, though if it wasn’t for us, the union would not exist. The union rep does not rep for everyone. The company you work for can do whatever to you, and the union backs them up against you therefore if that's the case, WHY ARE YOU HERE THEN, TAKING OUR MONEY???< /review>< Pictures>

There is a very helpful lady there at UFCW name Stacy. She was so polite and helped me  get everything that I needed to get done. She is very negotiable. She also told me about the discounts that I knew nothing about.
Thank you

No matter how the Union handles things, the bottom line is, I would not be living as well as I am without it. The company would not pay me  these wages unless it had to. I have no fear of being fired without due process. Non-unionized companies can fire at will and pay the bare minimum. I for one will appreciate  what the Union does for me, even if I don't agree on how they handle things.<//Review>

<review>Extremely unhelpful and very rude staff. I talked to a few people about my dues because they weren't being taken out due to the fact that my job didn't notify until 3 months after that I owe dues. No reps or organizers came to the store to sign me up. So the supervisor there was very unhelpful when I tried to explain the situation to her saying that there was nothing she could do not even an extension. Therefore, I had to call back a few days later to pay them and the lady I spoke to today Stacy was extremely rude I once again explained the situation to her and she was rude the whole time. I was trying to ask more questions and get an understanding of what happened and she was over it as soon as I started asking questions. I guess we're not suppose to ask questions because everything is online she kept saying. So they basically don't do anything in the office besides collects payments. Horrible customers service and waste of union if that's all they're doing.<//review><Rate>1< /Rate><resp>None</resp><UserId.>118010685901218511099</UserId.>< Name>

When you are drowning they offer you water. They pay no attention to detail or follow through. I did exactly what I was supposed to do when leaving a withdrawal card the moron that I handed paperwork to didn't do her part so where does that leave me even spoke with medical. Union wants "their" money they're not looking out for the workers (beware).  Preferred to leave zero stars.< /Review>

I was employed with Ralph’s a little over a year ago, I had quit and the reason for my quitting was because none of the bosses would give me the day off to go to my cousins Funeral his FUNERAL. I since then tried to apply and said I was not able to work for them since I had been RED FLAGGED. I know I am not wrong for quitting they also did have enough people to work my shift that day the manager just didn’t like me. It’s very unfair. I am extremely disappointed in a company that says it’s all about family but when it comes down to it does not help or care about the employee.<//Review>

Recently had to pay about $600 for medical expenses. When trying to sign up for health benefits I was just told, "You are too late." My work told me I could go in any time and sign up. I have to make an appeal in March to hopefully have them help with the expenses. Hopefully they help. If so the rating could change, but for now it feels like I am paying this place weekly to have them just sit around and not even show a penny back.< /Text>

<Review>The Union always has my back and I return it by being the Shop Steward. I have worked for my company for decades and have had disagreements like any family does.

Originally I was happy with my appointment 7 months ago. My doctor had spoken with me about a prescription which I turned down.  Now I would like to ask her about it but the front desk won’t even get a message to her.  They want me to pay for a full appointment when a 2 min conversation would do the job.  I forget we don’t have any care in our health care system.< /text>

My husband and I are happy to be a patients of Thrive Comprehensive Medicine for our family primary care. I am grateful for Dr Armin and his staff particularly Jennifer. I appreciate Dr. A’s thoroughness and attention to details. His office also offers high tech (patient portal, text communication) has a quick response rate, and is extremely helpful with any follow up questions or needs. I am confident having this office as my go to for my medical needs.< /text>

<review>All the staff is personable, listens to you and generally seems to do a good job. Referrals and visits get handled quite quickly and wait times before appointments never seem more than a. Handful of minutes.

The three stars is because of complications that arose as a result of me being unable to talk and trying to schedule an appointment. The website and phone number promote and advertise a text hotline, but .. they don't actually... Reply to it... Uh. Ever. And when you have physical damage to your ability to vocalize and have to call to make an appointment... It sucks fam. Either have a text option and use it not just to text reminders but actually reply to, or don't have one and don't advertise it.</review><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>109571042140961729566< /UserId.><date>1628025827997</date><Rate>3</Rate><pics>None</pics><gmapID>0x80c299cce4753ed9:0xc0d9d01d895932b4</gmapID>< user_name>

<Review>It seems impossible to find kind, honest, and personable doctors in a place like Los Angeles. Compared to the place I'm from, the doctors are so cold & greedy. Most take on too many patients and other greedy practices and don't care about their patients one bit. I'm so lucky to have found Thrive. The doctors are actually  caring. They truly care about your health.and happiness. I'm moving soon, close to my hometown. I wish I could take Thrive with me. I think that all of the doctors at Thrive are even better than the doctors where I'm from!<//Review><user_id>107558358681668855862</user_id></record>

I am very grateful for all the medical help I have received from this clinic.  They are very quick to respond, very friendly, and professional in their work.

My doctor Dr.  Duzik is truly an angel on earth who has been present all along during my health treatment.

Thanks to every person who works in this clinic.
You are truly angels.</Text>

Dr. Duzik, has been tremendously helpful and extremely competent. As a registered nurse, I chose Medicare' so that I am not restricted to one doctor.

I've been seeing Dr. Arasheben since shortly after his practice opened. I have been super pleased with him and my service at the office. He is always friendly, ready to listen, has given me excellent medical advice, and provided appropriate referrals when necessary. The only thing I wish they did in house was vaccinations and blood draws, but I do understand that is less common now for general practitioners.< /Text>

Yes, we do offer vaccinations such as the Flu, Pneumococcal, Tetanus, Hepatitis A/B, and and Shingles.  We are actively working on providing blood draws at the office.  The Covid19 pandemic has decreased the need for in-office blood draws, but as we return back to our normal operations, we are again working on initiating lab services.  Since labs are somewhat more time sensitive and critical services we would like to make sure it is appropriately setup before providing services at the office. Thank you for your continual support.  We hope you continue to stay healthy and need not use our services to begin with. In good health, Dr. Arasheben.'}</Response>

SO kind, respectful, and attentive.

<Text>My experience with Dr. Arasheben has been very positive. Through the years I've had several primary doctors and most I've kept, not because I trusted or even liked them as doctors, but because they were in my plan and probably logistically convenient. Dr. A really seems to really care about care he gives and I think he has a certain pride in that commitment. He goes out of his way to do so with follow-up and listening. This seems to be a busy office, so office wise, like speaking with someone in the billing dept. can be challenging, but I find that with almost every business these days.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c299cce4753ed9:0xc0d9d01d895932b4</gmap_id><user_name>Steve From Just Imagine<//user_name><time>1607630802092<//time><Pictures>None</Pictures><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

<Name>himeno vigo< /Name><Review>I went to Dr.A because I needed a new primary since my last does not take my new insurance. It was very easy to make an appointment for the day that I wanted. Since I’m in and out with patients all day it was nice that I could make the appointment by email as well. Dr. A was pretty thorough with his questions. He was really professional and took my concerns seriously and addressed each one of them. He offered diagnostics to rule out anything was wrong for each of my concerns and I have found that is not the case with a lot of doctors. So for someone that is as holistic as I am, it was nice to meet a doctor that wanted to prevent disease with diagnostics by catching something early and to have something to compare it to in the future. His staff was also very kind.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I've used Thrive for my primary care needs for the past year and have had a seamless experience with them. My medical needs and focuses are very straight-forward, for reference. I'm typically able to reach them by phone easily—especially during the Pandemic—and using their online portal to communicate with my DR or the front desk is super easy and I get a response in 24hrs.

Everyone is very friendly and insightful, open to questions and patient. I've used Dr Duzik and have found her to be a great ally.<//Text>

Doctors that care!! what a concept in this day and age.  Maybe its due to a small office but you get the care and attention that you want from a doctor/patient relationship.  They are vested in your health and well-being without feeling like you are rushed.  My hubby and I both give 2 thumbs up to the front desk, nurses and doctors.  Keep up the great work!</Review>

{'time': 1602245346348, 'text': "Hi Unica. First, I'd like to apologize for any inconveniences caused. We currently have 3 dedicated staff members picking up the phone, and we are in the process of training an additional front desk staff member.  Since the Covid19 pandemic started our in-bound call rates have tripled.  Also, we take measures to keep the phone lines open even during front desk staff's spread lunch hours (12:00pm-2:00pm) They do pick up the phone, but at a lower capacity.  We also have dedicated staff members who stay until 6:30pm daily to make sure we address all pending issues, and contact patients as needed.\nUnfortunately, our providers have also noted a significant increase in their work loads, rendering us unable to just pick up the phone for casual conversations with patients.  However, in cases of an Urgent issue, our staff will get a provider on the phone right away; while rescheduling their current pending patient appointments or informing pending patients of a delay in their visit with the provider.  We went to great lengths to enable patients to use their most comfortable mean of communications. You can send us text messages, call, use emails, and use the patient portal to communicate with your provider Directly.  Please take a moment to fill-out our Feedback form [ https://thrivecmg.com/feedback/ ]   Our administrative staff will review your comments and even call you to discuss.  Your feedback is important to us, as it allows us to identify areas for improvement.  We always hope to provide you with the best care possible.  I understand the frustration you voiced regarding the calls. We treat all our patients with great respect, and we understand that your time is precious. Please take the time to fill out our online form. I wish you great health, and again I thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.  In good health, Dr. Arasheben"}< /Resp>

CAN NEVER GET IN CONTACT TO ASK AN APPOINTMENT, TO  SAY SOMETHING TO THE DOCTOR OR ANYTHING AT ALL. THEY DON'T PICK UP THE PHONE.    I MUST SEND EMAILS AND THEY ARE NOT ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY. HERE  YOU ARE NOT A PERSON BUT SECOND OR THIRD CLASS CLIENT. I PREFER A BETTER AND MORE HUMANE RAPORT WITH MY MEDICAL PROVIDERS.< /Text>

I just started going to this practice as a friend of mine highly recommended Dr. Arasheben. I am so thankful she did because I’ve had positive visits and only have good things to say about him and the staff.  He is thorough and really seems to care about your well being and his staff is courteous and professional.  I already  recommended him to friends!<//review>

I have been a patient of Dr.A for a few years now and I can’t see myself seeing another doctor. I feel he takes the time to understand his patients. He always explains things to me and answers all my questions. Andrea is also great, she is very knowledgeable. They also have great office staff. I contact them a lot via phone and text and they always respond in a timely manner and have been so helpful when I needed prescription refills or documents. They never seem annoyed with me when I have had to contact them in need of something. Overall great doctors office. I even made sure my new insurance is excepted by them because I haven’t had this kind of effective care since my pediatrician.<//Review>

Dr. Duzik is awesome! She let me go on and on about how I was feeling and listened with genuine concern and curiosity. She then offered her helpful (and expert) advise on how I should proceed. I was very concerned when I had to switch my prior doctor to an unknown- but now I’m so glad fate has brought me to a real cool new doctor- Dr. Duzik!
(My only complaint has to do with the difficulty in getting ahold of the staff. Almost everyone I call- the phones are busy but it never allows me to go to voicemail and leave a message. I have much better luck emailing the office.)<//review>

I've been coming to Thrive Medical Group for a good 3 years now.  Dr Arashaben has been my primary physician and I can say my experience is great.  I recently went in and Dr Duzik treated me and I was happy with the treatment and experience that day.  I came right on time and got to see the doctor quickly, with minimal wait.  My favorite part is that it's easy to communicate with the doctors in here, which really helps me grasp what I need to work on to lead a healthier life.</Text>

I now have the decision to change my PCP as my interaction with Dr. Arasheben was amazing!! He is truly a Dr to aspire to be with a bedside manner missing from many others..

The doctor flaked on my appointment yesterday and didn’t even call me to explain. I then proceeded to give them one more chance and scheduled yet another appointment. Well the doctor didn’t show up again and didn’t bother to call me. This is very unprofessional and unacceptable.</Text>

{'time': 1614870536793, 'text': "Good morning David.  First I apologize for the inconveniences caused. I have known you for the past 3 years, and I've spent much time caring for you; at times for free when you did not have insurance coverage.  It is never my intention to cause delays, and I am very much aware that your time is precious.  I  was not able to call you after hours that same day, as my grandmother was urgently sent to Cedars Sinai Medical Providence Medical Center and I had to check on her as soon as I could. (I also did not notice that our staff has moved your appointment time to an after-hours slot) That was my fault.  Nonetheless, I called you early the next day, reviewed all your medications, and sent them to the pharmacy.  I do still care for your well-being and hope you continue to stay healthy.  It is disappointing to see the star rating, as I and the rest of our providers/staff members work very very hard to care for our patients every day of the week (7 days a week. I've spoken to you multiple times for urgent issues on the weekend as well).  Be mindful, that ratings should take into account the quality of providers and medical care provided, the quality of the front desk staff, facility status, use of electronic patient portal to improve communications and decrease mistakes, and everyone's willingness to take that extra step to help with your medical concerns.\nAgain, I apologize for missing our appointment as I had an emergent medical issue to address as specified above. As discussed by phone, I am only human and I am bound to disappoint our patients from time to time.  I am wishing you the best of health. May you not need to use our services to begin with.  Thank you for choosing us to oversee your medical care. In good health, Dr. Arasheben."}<//resp>

They care about you as a patient and your sickness, not see you as a business! So far, I had appointments with three different doctors and they are all nice and very knowledgeable!

Kind and caring staff - knowledgeable doctors. I called at 9am and got a tele-apt the same day when needed. Easy to talk to doctors who actually care and work hard to try and help you. I've been to many doctors (unfortunately) and this office is seriously my favorite if only for the KINDNESS of everyone in it. Highly recommend that if you can, you choose Thrive Comprehensive as your new doctor's office.<//review>

<text>I went through a tele appointment with Andrea Holzman  for a general health check very recently. Though Dr. Andrea, (as I would like to call her), is a Nurse Practitioner by profession she's as good, if not better than a Medical Doctor in some respects and that's the highest compliment I can give.
She displays all of the qualities a patient would look for from a medical professional like good bedside manners, patience in answering all kinds of questions, compassion, gentle and positive way of giving feedback to patients with a high degree of competence.

Andrea is a great medical professional who is highly recommended.< /text>< pictures>

Dr. Armin is one of the best doctors I have ever met, he is professional, enthusiastic, kind, he spends time with his patient, he is very concerned about the patient's health and also the financial part. I would like to return with him if possible every day. He is a jovial person. He is an expert in internal medicine, the people who work with him are very friendly. Shaddy, if you are reading this review, you are an exceptional person.
Thank you, thank you very much...

<text>Dr.Duzik is a kind doctor, who listens and   answers my questions and concerns. I am new here, I have medicare and the doctor I did have moved out of network. But I am very pleased with the change. Last year and the first time going there they saw me right away 😂 and gave me the medical care and medicine to make me better. I had asperated pneumonia which was diagnosed on the spot. With covid-19, a new challenge for all, they have adapted to still being available either by phone or in person. We don't want to have to to see a doctor but when we do this is a nice place to come to get better.< /text>< rating>

I used to be the kind of person who went to see a doctor every two years because other clinics made me feel unheard or foolish for the health issues I was having so I'd only go if I absolutely needed to. I'm so blessed to have found Dr. Arashaben's office. I feel very comfortable with the doctors, nurse practitioners, and nurses at Thrive. They listen to me and try to provide the best care for me that they possibly can. The facility is bright, clean, and a very pleasant environment to be in. I highly recommend them.<//Review>< pictures>

<username>G Blair<//username><text>Called Thrive at 10:40am to ask doctor to refill RX that needed doctor's approval. Friendly, efficient front desk asked if an 11:15am telemedicine appt would be convenient for me & she set it up. Dr. Duzik called me back right on time. She spent 15 minutes asking me many questions & asked if I needed anything else. Great to know I can get fast, efficient medical help if I need it, especially during Covid. Everyone at Thrive is always friendly & cheerful, which is nice too. Getting a response from a live person is a miracle these days! I can't get through to a human at BestBuy or DSW to ask a question since they don't pick up the phones. Thank God for doctors & nurses & efficient administrative help who answer phones at the front desk! And getting a call back from a doctor in 35 minutes is exceptional!<//text>< time>

<text>I'm so happy with my experience at Thrive Comprehensive, Andrea was so nice and explained everything so well, the front receptionist needs to be more organized or learn how to communicate better because she made an appointment for me to have an ultrasound tech appointment and at the end when I was there she was like "the ultrasound tech isnt here" she could've called me and let me know but I didnt received any call back. She looks like she has to much her plate or at least more than she can handle. But the Dr. Saw me her name is Andrea and she did so good she has really good communication skills she explained everything so well and asked if I had any questions or concerns to let her know making me feel really comfortable.<//text>< Pics>

There aren't enough good things I can say about Dr. Arasheben, Dr. Duzik and the staff at Thrive. They are the BEST!! I was initially nervous about finding a new primary care doctor, but am so glad I did. Appointments were set up super easy/quick. The team at Thrive has been so kind and patient. They take the time to listen and address any questions or concerns you might have. They make you feel comfortable, informed, and have overall peace-of-mind regarding your health/wellbeing.</review>

<Text>I know that I've reviewed here before for Dr. Arasheben, but I just met with the new doctor here, Ashley Duzik, and HAD to write a review! She was so kind and helpful. I have an autoimmune condition that I'm trying to monitor, and sometimes I think that I come off sounding a little like a hypochondriac, but Dr. Duzik made me feel heard. She was understanding about some of the problems I'm experiencing and explained which blood tests I need and which I don't. She was more than willing to work with me on this. She was even encouraging about my cholesterol, my interest in my own health, and my new nutrition program. I'm so grateful for how today's appointment went. And the best part? It was telemedicine (perfect for this pandemic)!

Armin called me after hours and i was at an awe. He listens, he complements me on my accomplishments, he’s concerned, he attentively listens, he shows so much passion and empathy while speaking to me. I will follow my doctor wherever he go if he relocates. I am overly pleased with each encounter even if it’s a phone call. I never met a doctor that’s so Tenacious about their patients until I met Dr. Arasheban. He does not only care for myself but my family as well. I’m so happy to be their patient. He works hard to please everyone and his front office staff is incredible. When i call to make an appointment they are sweet and actually call back when they say they will and accommodate me when i feel it’s an emergency rather large or small. I truly feel blessed.. thank you to the doctors and staff for caring.

( and I really loved my previous Dr. in Beverly Hills ( Dr. Roohipour)-  I experience a human being that cares about healing and listens to his patients-

He is very knowledgeable and cared about my overall well being and general health. Also the tele medicine works very well. we concentrated much on current tests and also he provided me with advise how to prevent certain conditions that keep make me feel sick. He was also very well informed about all my medical conditions and needs although he saw m only two times. Thanks Dr. Armin- And thanks to your front office for great admin and communication.  See you around September 2020- again.< /review>< pictures>

The doctor was very nice my first visit when I got an appointment first thing in the morning. My second appointment was in the afternoon, after waiting 45 minutes after my scheduled appointment and hearing the doctor finishing up in the other room next to mine, I was assuming I’d be next. I ask the receptionists and learn it will be at least another 30 minutes before I’m seen, when I’m seeing the doctor for severe nausea. I don’t feel good and since no one in the doctors office could help me I had to leave. I schedule a new appointment asking if they are behind on schedule, they say no and the same thing happens they are over an hour behind appointments and I have to leave. Then I schedule an appointment for first thing in the morning. I get the second appointment of the day which is at 11:15, the first being at 11, but the receptionist tells me that the 11 appointment will take 45 minutes. So why are they scheduling every 15 minutes when they know the appointments take longer. I see the doctor and he gives me the wrong dosage for both my medications and blindly asks if I want to increase my dosage. And throughout this whole time, which has been about 3 months, my insurance company has tried to get information on why I need a brain MRI and they won’t give my insurance the information so I can’t get the MRI I need.< /text>

If you necessarily need the first appointment of the day, please ask for that explicitly. This may delay your scheduled date by 1-2 days to assure first appointment scheduling.  Since you were having nausea and vomiting our staff was trying to accommodate you for the first available appointment which was for 11:15am.  Our scheduling is per First come, first served basis.\n2. I am very fast and comprehensive at my approach to patients. However the staff can not foresee complicated cases before scheduling appointments.   Please be mindful that we are not selling products, but rather caring for patients lives.  I have to do my best to provide appropriate care for our patients and sometimes we run late.  Our staff, is also diligent at keeping our waiting patients informed so they can determine their schedule appropriately.  Our staff was simply trying to inform you on my delay in seeing you on time.  I'm not sure how better to run the clinic based on your comments.\n3. Dosage administration: Your medication is taken chronically, and you complained that it did not work for you. It is natural to ask if you'd like to have a dosage increase or change the medication all together. I apologize if there was any misunderstanding on the dosage you were taking.  We document medication dosages in the room with the patient and refill them instantaneously to avoid future mistakes.\n4. Brain MRI: (This is based on information you provided independently) You came in for nausea and vomiting and asked for a brain MRI, which is very unlikely to be approved based on our history and physical exam documentation. Despite warning that it may not be approved, we still sent the referral on your behalf. After review of our documentation, we sent documents requested multiple times to your insurance.  We can not followup with the insurance to guarantee processing.\nAfter 3 months, it came to my attention that you have left this review online. I contacted you to ask regarding the nature of the MRI denial ONLY (I did not discuss the nature of this review with you).  I then called your insurance and scheduled a peer-to-peer review call, which finally resulted in an approval of your MRI.  You were expected to receive an authorization letter from your insurance.  Please proceed with completing the exam as approved.\n\nI wish you would fill out our feedback form to bring these issues to my attention thrivecmg.com/feedback\nPlease keep an open line of communications with your new PCP and their front desk staff.  This will ensure better response to your concerns and ultimately better satisfaction of the care provided.\n\n***   We have implemented our new patient portal that allows direct communications between patients and providers.  Hopefully this service will improve physician-patient communications and further enhance satisfaction of care provided.  thrivecmg.com/registrati…\n\nAgain, I apologize for any miscommunications or inconveniences caused.  Please contact our staff with your new PCP's fax number so we can transfer all your records to them for review.\nIn good health,\nDr. Arasheben."}<//Response>< GmapID>

Despite my best efforts, I cannot get the Al's automated diabetic monitor approved by his insurance plan.  The automated monitor requires specific criteria to be met before approval is granted. I initially sent the request twice. After speaking with you, and on the basis of Al's nursing care manager, we changed the terms of the request and resubmitted two more times. Unfortunately, you must receive at least 4 insulin injections per day, with further criteria to be considered for approval. We cannot confabulate the information submitted.  We must submit accurate requests on your behalf.  This information was also relayed to you by our front desk staff. I have also discussed with Rose (Al's manager) on weekly basis to manage his care and change his medications. I was not informed that you had further questions.  We have truly attempted to address the issue and provide you with the insulin monitor as per your request, but there is only so much we can do.  We all care for Al's well-being, and we are closely monitoring his sugar status, by discussing care with his board and care managers and changing his insulin dosage as per medical guidelines.  Please consider removing or updating your current star rating as it reflects poorly on our establishment as a whole.  Thank you for choosing us to oversee Al's medical care.

He really does share not only his knowledge but also of himself. He has truly been a blessing in my life. He is an amazing doctor , and he truly cares about his patients. He is the definition and epitome of a true physician. Trust me, go to him, and experience medicine at its absolute best!</review>

Dr Arasheben is fantastic; he's attentive and worries not only about your health but also about your pocket!  Most importantly, the entire team is amazing, very responsive and friendly.  They get back to you very quick, you barely have to wait for your appointment, and you can even schedule appointments via email.  I changed my PCP because my previous doc had me wait for 2.5 hrs in the waiting room, the staff was completely not responsive (they wouldn't EVER pick up the phone), and the doc didn't even list to my issues.  Dr Arasheben is diametrically opposite in every single one of these issues. I'm glad I changed docs!<//text>

Dr. Arasheben is a GREAT doctor and for many reasons. He is extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and listens carefully to your concerns/issues you are going through and provides excellent solutions to them. The Dr's office as well is very comfortable, clean, and an overall great atmosphere. No long wait times either...

Our medical providers and staff are dedicated to providing a high quality of care, and we take the extra step to make sure you receive the care you need.  We carefully review your suggestions and implement changes in our office to improve care for future patients as well.\n\n*** Response from Quest Labs representative: (Physician Account Executive) "This patient was sent to our draw station and checked for eligibility but there\'s no way for us to know details of her policy. Our draw stations do not have access to insurance benefits for each patient on the internet."\n\nOur Response to your comments:\n-We can only check eligibility for patient plans under our name. We are not able to check eligibility for patients under lab services, radiology services and specialty doctor services such as Cardiology, dermatology, gastroenterology etc. Only the contracted provider, whomever it may be, can review your eligibility status for their own services, at the time of visit.\n- We suggested Quest Labs to patients, as we frequently get asked to recommend a lab.  Quest accepts the largest number of insurances at this point.\n-  We are in no way affiliated with quest laboratories. We don\'t have any financial incentives to send patients to their facilities. Quest laboratories has never supported us in any contractual way.\n\nOffice Protocol Changes:\n- We have revised our lab list handout to reflect multiple labs.\n- The notes will state that it is a suggested lab list, and encourage patients to check eligibility status before consenting to services.\n\nSuggestion:\n- Please review our new policies and consider revising the above mentioned review.\n\nThank you for taking the time to comment about our services.  It will certainly help future patients and decrease rate of miscommunications.  We are grateful for the opportunity to oversee your medical care.\n\nIn good health,  Dr. Arasheben'}</response>

If I could give a negative review, I definitely will. Even though the doctor is very knowledgeable, he doesn't know how to manage his office. I came in and asked for an annual check up. He sent me to Quest Diagnosis without letting me know that they are not in my network. I ended up get charged more than $1200. When I called the office to verify if the test lab is in network, she responded that they don't have visibility. That is weird since you guys have a point of contact with Quest Diagnostic, you should be able to know if they are in network or not. If you really don't know, at least let the patient choose their own labs instead of sending them to your preferred lab  without verifying that information. Please be more professional!</Text>

Dr. Arasheben is a patient and kind doctor. He takes the time to hear all of your problems and doesn't just brush off symptoms like so many others do. I can't say enough good things about the Doc but possibly even more important, his staff is top notch and friendly! The staff at my previous two primary physician's offices were unfriendly. Making an appointment seemed to be too much for them at times, but the staff at thrive are wonderful. I recommend Dr. Arasheben highly.</Review>

<text>Dr. Arasheben is awesome. For the first visit, he spent quite some time with me. She uncovered some issues other than what I was there for and made plans with me to address these issues also.  He is knowledgeable, compassionate, and direct. Staff in the office was great too.  It is easy to get an appointment and the entire staff is gracious.  I am so glad I found my new primary care physician.<//text>< pics>

Dr. Arasheben and his staff are highly competent and very thorough. You can expect to be seen promptly, and when Dr. Arasheben steps into your exam room, he is 100% present and focused on you. He listens and waits for you to finish your thought, then responds with a carefully reasoned response. If you're looking for a family doctor, look no further!</Text>

<Text>A truly remarkable remarkable doctor with terrific bedside manner. Kind, sharp and caring. Makes my last doctor seem like an amateur by comparison. It feels great to finally find a doctor who acts like a partner in maintaining your health as opposed to one who sees you as a profit center. I couldn't recommend Dr. Arasheben any more emphatically.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I recently changed insurance and as I have a few medical issues I didn't know how care would work out with a new doctor. The atmosphere is great at the office as the girls in front are calmly efficient, you feel they are serious and care about their jobs whilst being friendly. Very little wait time. Dr Arasheben is fantastic, he really cares about doing the best for his patient, is enthusiastic, responsive, clever and funny, not at all stuffy or distracted. He took all my medical history and is very proactive in figuring out the appropriate steps whilst including the patient's input. He puts into place the necessary follow-ups regarding medical conditions across a broad spectrum. I highly recommend Thrive Comprehensive Medical Group and am very happy I found it.<//text>

I am glad that your results were normal, and there was no delay in treatment.    RESPONSE: Our staff called to inform you of the results.  They can only ask you to call back instead of leaving the contents of the ultrasound results on your voice message.\nCORRECTIVE ACTIONS: Your story is currently under investigation by the management team.  1. I am not sure who told you we "lost" the results or the diagnostic studies.  It is on our computers, including both the study and the radiologist read.  2. We are tracking the turn around time for relaying ultrasound results to patients.   It should still be 2-3 business days for receiving them and 1-2 days for relaying them to patients.  A corrective action will be taken if we do not find this to be the case.\nSUGGESTIONS TO YOU:  1. If you ever work with a stable establishment, and have problems with any of the staff or services, I would recommend you to ask to speak to a manager for further help.  Our management team is dedicated to serving our patients.  They bring all complaints to my attention to address urgently.

In writing a review regarding an establishment, we always recommend our patients to get to know us and consider multiple factors including the quality of our physicians and their care, front desk staff, Effectiveness of care provided on your health, timeliness of the checkin process, Facility review, etc.\n*** Please accept my apologies for the delay in relaying the results to you.  I encourage you to come back for further care, should you need anything in the future.

I went here for abdominal pain and after some time and a few test they had me do an in office ultrasound. They said I'd have my results in 2-3 business days, 2 WEEKS or so later they still hadn't called about the results so I called them. They told me that they didn't have the results and that I shouldn't call again they'd call me when the got the results. Another 2-3 WEEKS go by then I receive a voicemail (I missed their call) saying they had very important information about my results and it was important that I called them back right away. After a few frantic calls and messages to them thinking I had something seriously wrong with me, I finally reach them only to find out that THEY HAD LOST MY RESULTS. How do you lose results? Don't you have computers and file backups, this was done in office so there are is no real transport, where did it go? I told this to a few of my friends in the medical and nursing field and they were just as appalled and confused as I was, some were even anger that they let that happen. A lot of wasted time and money here. 0 Stars even without this incident I wouldn't give them more than 2 stars, not sure where these 5 stars come from. It's just really careless and unprofessional, beware of this place. UPDATE: They called me to tell me the had my results only after I posted this review (3 months after my results should have been in.)< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I think it's difficult not to feel the terrific limitations and time constraints that the insurance industry inflict on the medical profession.
Dr. Arasheban and his staff manage doing this good as ANY one can. He and his staff are competent and patient and the Doc himself is very good at giving you your due time with his knowledgable experience. My husband and I trust him and really like him.</Review>

<response>{'time': 1476115262300, 'text': "Dear Alexander, First I would like to apologize for the way you perceived the care provided at the clinic. At ThriveCMG the staff and medical providers are dedicated to providing excellent customer service and medical advice. =====  1.  It is obvious you spent a significant amount of time to leave your review. This is an indication that your experience was certainly less than adequate. =====   2.  Yes, when someone has anything good to say, they usually keep it short, by highlighting the positive points of the clinic and the physician. Less time is spent to leave a positive review than a negative review. =====  3.  I'm not sure how you can find out where the yelp reviews come from, but please be aware that we get many new patients at the clinic, and the majority are coming from other towns.  Yelp accounts may have been created many years ago and they are probably not often updated demographically.  Thus, those particular patients may now live in the Los Angeles area. =====  4. All our patients who require a followup visit receive an appointment reminder card. On the back of the card we list all our online review links and ask ALL our patient to leave their comments and review us online.  Also, our email communications have all our online review links on it for easier access.  We ask all our patients to leave their comments on multiple sites so that new patients hear about us. BY DOING SO, WE TAKE THE RISK OF GETTING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REVIEWS EQUALLY.  WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN MEASURES TO LEAVE REVIEWS ON OUR OWN OR BY OUR STAFF. WE ALSO NEVER PAID ANYONE TO LEAVE US REVIEWS ONLINE.  ALL REVIEWS ARE ORGANICALLY GENERATED WITHOUT ANY MANIPULATION. =====   You are a healthy young man and I'm glad that's the case. If you had comorbidities, I would spend my time asking more questions and providing education. We have established our appointment schedule based on UCLA, Kaiser, and Cedar Sinai recommended timing.  We do not take walk in appointments, thus we have time to spend with our patients. We do not focus on running through patients, rather we spend the time to care for our patients. I hope you will never learn the burden of sickness in your lifetime.  However, patients that are older and have multiple comorbidities, highly appreciate the pace of care they get, especially the fact that we take care of an average 3-6 medical problems per session. That saves the patient the need to see us again, and allows them to focus on their non-medical lives instead.  =====  I would recommend that you come see us again when and if you are ill in any way.  You will then see the care in a much different way, as you'll see for yourself the care and compassion we offer our patients. =====  I would like to thank you for allowing my staff and I to oversee your medical care, and wish you the best of health.   Dr. Arasheben."}<//response>< name>

Look at Yelp reviews, at least 4-5 by people from San Diego. Who in right mind would travel from San Diego to Tarzana for a Physician? The rest are from Los Angeles (still a bit far, no?) Just a couple from reasonable travel distance to the office. Also, both Yelp and Google reviews have same posters. I smell Bull$h|t..

I showed up 10 min before scheduled time (like you should) and saw the doctor 30 min after the scheduled time.
When I finally got in, I felt like I was at an auction. He quickly rattled off the basic questions (you allergic to anything, any family history, etc) The whole thing took 10 minutes max. I felt like he just wants to get through as many people as possible in shortest time possible. (same was noted by other 1 star reviewers)
He ordered a handful of standard tests, was never told which labs I can go to.
My last doctor had a normal pace conversation with me, no rush. Explained what tests he wanted to do and why. Gave me options of local labs and their time of operation along with instructions for fasting, etc
I was scheduled to comeback 4 days later at 9 am.
9:05am the office doors were locked and staff was waiting outside saying they have no keys to get in as they are temps.

This practice is very good at hiring people to write reviews and drum up customers.. Being on time or attentive? not so much.</review>< Date>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I chose to come here because it was close to my job and recommended by two of my friends. I had a concussion from a training accident. Staff was super nice and welcoming. I got to visit the same day. After filling out the paperwork I saw Dr. A fairly quickly. He listened to my story and after performing some neurologic examinations he said he rulled out major problems. He was comfortable that no MRI was needed in my case. He took the time to teach me how to take care of myself. The next week I had my good and bad days. I left a message and Dr. A called me back to answer my questions. His staff was nice enough to follow up with me to ask how I was doing. I only paid my copay which is part of the insurance card. With their good care, I switched my doctor to this office.</Review>< Resp>

<Text>I have contacted the office via phone, email, and thru their online contact request form on several occasions and never heard back from anyone trying to make an appointment.  Come 3 weeks+ later, I try again, only to get a call from a front desk associate who did not know what insurance coverage the office accepted, put me on hold to go find out, hangs up on me and when I finally get a call back, still did not sound like she knew and refused to get someone else on the phone.  Good thing they showed me their unprofessional behavior toward anyone inquiring to visit this office. Speaks a lot for how their office is run.  Disrespectful and very unprofessional. I'd give it a -10 rating if I could.<//Text><userid>116884149292220714216</userid><Date>1507671701880</Date>< Resp>

Dr Arasheben is the best doctor I have ever seen. He has wonderful bedside manner, he listens, he pays attention to each patient and treats them with respect and empathy. I feel like I have a well rounded dr appointment whenever I go there. Because he doesn't leave anithing out. He's very maticulous and great at his job. He's also a wonderful human being! I couldn't possible give him the proper praise because he's too damn good! The staff is also wonderful. The ladies are all very helpfu, very nice and very pretty :). Definitely recommend this doctor to all that are sick and tired of being treated like a number and not a person.</text>

I had to change to a new PCP and doing lots of research and checking reviews on Dr Arasheben and Dr Beroukhim I was so happy today at my first appt. with Dr. Arasheben.  I have been to many Drs over the years and have a good comparison barometer. It was a very positive appt and I felt he really listened to me, very attentive and offered options and discussed me as an individual rather than just another patient.  I very much appreciate being able to connect with this office and encourage anyone to go to this practice.  It is very rare to find quality, kindness, expertise and guidance from Drs in general.  Dr Arasheben made me feel at ease and he is sincere in his treatment and again offering options.  The office staff was very kind and helpful with the new insurance process and what to expect.  Very grateful for connecting and the ease of healthcare ! Thank you !!< /Text>

<gmap_id>0x80c299cce4753ed9:0xc0d9d01d895932b4<//gmap_id><text>I'm not a big fan of going to the doctor. In fact, my last checkup was over 2 years ago. So after incessant nudging from my family I decided to find a doctor. I checked healthgrades and yelp and saw how many positive reviews Dr. Arasheben has. Like you, I've been dissapointed by businesses with positive reviews before - but there was something that struck me about all of the reviews. So many people said that Dr. Arasheben was extremely pleasant and that he listens to your concerns. I figured if at least a few of those people were right it was worth a shot - so I decided to make an appointment.

Unlike so many doctors, Dr. Arasheben believes in using technology. His website allows you to request an appointment and also complete all of the pre-visit paperwork ahead of time so that you don't have to do it on a clipboard in the office (though you can if you want... but why?) I emailed with the office staff a few times and secured an appointment.

Dr. Arasheben's office is simple, clean and unassuming. It's on the bottom floor of an office building in Tarzana with parking in the back. The front desk staff is nice and since I already filled out all of the paperwork I just had to sign a few forms. I was escorted to an exam room within a few minutes.

It was there I first met the doctor. Dr. Arasheben is extremely warm and pleasant. But he's also extremely knowledgable and nonjudgmental. I discussed a few medical issues with him, and he immediately made suggestions that were thoughtful and workable. He sent me for labs and tests, and within a few days I received a call about a potential health issue that we needed to discuss. I booked an appointment with the person who called.

In the subsequent visit, Dr. Arasheben was very thorough and detailed in his explanation, but also assured me that the issue wasn't extremely severe. However, we made a plan to track the issue and answered every question I had.

I've had one subsequent visit to discuss other lab results and my experience was the same. In addition, I emailed the office with a question and received a timely reply.

I suppose we all have different needs from a doctor, but if you're looking for someone who listens, is extremely knowledgable (and up-to-date in medical research) and is very pleasant, then you can't go wrong with Dr. Arasheben.</text>< resp>

<Review>I came in for my annual check up and had some concerns with hypertension. The MA who treated me prior to the Dr's arrival was very polite and helped me feel at ease while she was taking my vitals and performing an ekg.
Dr Arasheben took his time to explain everything to me and hear all of my questions without seeming like he had other things on his mind or that he was pressed for time. As always, he demonstrated enthusiasm and sincere concern during my visit. I recommend every one in the SFV, Encino, Tarzana, and Studio City areas check out his clinic.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c299cce4753ed9:0xc0d9d01d895932b4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The first time I went because I had a skin problem and the second time I had pain in my stomach. Both times I felt comfortable with the doctor, he took his time asking me important questions, and even called me the next day to see how I felt with the stomach ache. The girls in front are very friendly just like the doctor. Dr. Arasheben will definitely be my doctor from now on.

(Original)
Me encanto el Dr. Arasheben! Vi al doctor dos veces. La primera vez fui porque tenia una problema de la piel y segunda vez tenia dolor en el estomago. Las dos veces me senti comoda con el doctor, se tomo su tiempo preguntandome preguntas importantes, y hasta me llamo el siguiente dia para ver como me sentia con el dolor de estomago. Las muchachas en frente son muy amable igual que el doctor. Dr. Arasheben definitivamente sera mi doctor de ahora en adelante.<//Text>< Rating>

The shop was clean and Sanitary. All the aisles were tempting to walk through just to see what else they have. I'll definitely be returning to 40th Smoke Shop for all my future smoking needs.

I immediately called the business and the staff was courteous and without hesitation said bring it back and replace with no problem. So all in all I was satisfied, I would definitely recommend and also they have a very large selection of items, at a very reasonable rate...<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c353ee09a5a455:0xd9f2ff51dfddeaa9<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

Went in for my first time, was helped by Raid. He was very helpful and polite. Looking forward to coming back! This shop had a great variety of different supplies. Overall I was pleased and would recommend it to others.<//Review>

Real talk don't go here they got everything cheaper at every other smoke shop and will charge unnecessary 2.55$ fee for debit transactions. Save the money and time by not going here.</review>

Awesome place. They have everything you would ever need for building or fixing your smoking device. Large selection of glass pipes and bongs, grinders, torches, vape, cigs, they have everything. Friendly staff greats you at the door and knowledgeable about all their products. Very reasonably priced</review>

This is my fiancé’s favorite shop to buy gifts for me at. The pieces are great and the pricing a good as well. No issues until today when he went in and was treated pretty rudely. The person who helped him out was not very hospitable and made my fiancé feel bad about our price range. Being that he only goes in for gifts, he looks for input from the person helping him, today he wanted something cute and when he talked about that he was told “she’s your girl man, what’s cute to her?” And hearing that really upset me. Cute is a very general term but I’ve never met someone who couldn’t describe something as cute or even girly. The piece he ended up getting is adorable and I love it but we both wish he felt more welcome to really explore all the options today. Might shop again as he’s usually treated very well when he goes and always comes home smiling but this experience was just not a good one.< /Text>

Best smoke shop around! Open late and great prices. Also love their selection of hookah's. The owner is great and so is the rest of the team. Only shop I go too. Even though it's about 20 min away from me, it's worth it.< /Review>

<text>The two gentlemen who were there that night were really nice. Their prices are good too. Just felt a little rushed since I arrived there about 20 minutes prior to the shop closing. They told me the store closes in 8 minutes- then when I left and got to my car, I looked back and they let another person in...

Seriously I've been going there for at least 5 years and it takes me 30 minutes to get there. But the new guys they have working are not all bad, they're just make me not want to spend a dime sometimes they're so expensive and dont do deals when spending over 100 bucks there many, MANY times a month as well as 1000s in the past. I would prefer to be assisted by the guys who have been working there the longest.</Review>< Pics>

Wanting to buy a new tank and a couple of juices, i went in and found one of the most helpful owners... i had quite a few questions regarding my new tank (very inexpensive by the way), and was served with all the answers, both in a professional and courteous manner. I had some difficulty (I'm new to vaping), and the owner gladly offered his expertise and made sure that i was satisfied before i left. I would recommend this shop to ALL!<//Text>

Theyve been selling me tobaco products since i was 16. I know all their names and they all know me. I have had differences with their work ethic before, but this was the last straw. First off the kid behind the counter was so high he couldnt do 150 times 2 in his head.
He kept me waiting while he did math over and over on his phone and was extremely rude for no reason after they had ALREADY CHARGED ME. Extremely unprofessional and i made it very clear id never, ever be back.<//text>

Decent prices, nice inventory, helpful staff. Just in the ghetto. Only reason for 4 stars.</Text>

The owner sells me a glass piece on the premise that it is unbreakable. Demonstrates by hitting glass piece on the display. I buy it, take it hope, drop it on carpet...CARPET to show a friend. Shatters. Owner then tries to sell me a piece at half price to make up for the bad advertisement.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.< /text>

Sold me a defective torch. When I went to exchange it the next day, not even return it just a simple exchange...I was told I couldn't cause there "was nothing wrong with it" if that's the case why not exchange it?....Dude behind the counter with glasses is a lame. Tried to do all he could to avoid me talking with the manager. They need to fire that lop.<//Review>

It's a smoke shop. They have a terrible setup. The cigarette cases are right in front of the register so it's difficult to look at cases when it's busy.< /review>

<review>The food is good and prices are very reasonable. It's a casual atmosphere, hole in the wall, local spot. Pictured is shrimp pad thai, beef fried rice and mango sticky rice. It's bit off the beaten path but GPS takes you right there. My friends and I usually order food for pick up or have it delivered on an app. The people are very nice!< /review>< pictures>

Not good Thai food. made the mistake of coming back to this place after having bad pad thai here the first time. Tried the pad see ew But unfortunately it's so bad, and somehow smells like a barnyard. Completely unedible I had to throw the whole thing in the trash, hot. The owners/ chef are very sweet and I understand it's trying times right now but they need to get better recipes.< /text>

Food ok, pad Thai chicken was juicy.

Unfortunately, cashier didn't wear any PPE with COVID around. His gear was hanging beside him< /Review>

<review>It is Oakland - There are many other better options.

Ordering experience:
1. Made my order over the phone and was told food will be ready in ten minutes and be there by then.
2. Even though he takes credit card, the owner of a one man shop insisted I pay in cash once he saw a few bills in my wallet. I said I need the cash and he kept insisting I give him some cash and pay some on my card - LOL - I called in the order to support local biz by not using the menu app.
3. Right after signing the reciept, he says, okay, give me 10 minutes to cook your food. Ha - so I guess he didn't trust my phone order which he got wrong and over charged me for anyways.

Quality Summary:
-WASTE OF MY TIME
-PAD SEE-EW - very very meh (it is not my fav dish anyways)
-CRAB FRIED RICE: very meh - not the worst but close to one of the worst
-GREEN AND PANANG CURRY was watery - Both Curry Dishes were funny colored, meat was rubber, and not creamy at all
-SHRIMP ROLLS - Never even made it into my bag even though I asked multiple times if everyting was in there.
-SICK FACTOR - Hopefully I don't get sick now 🤭<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Hidden Gem!!! Excellent food I would have never thought to find here. Family operated. "Mom" is the cook and she knows her stuff!! Somewhat difficult to find, nested in the back of an alley, so take an extra minute to look for it. Do not expect a fancy place. This is no frills but VERY good food. I'd come back anytime<//text>

Strange, hole-in-the wall place with a hard to place homey feel. Food was great and reasonably priced. Would definitely come back.

And to second what someone else said... their Thai Tea is GREAT.</text>

There was a mold on a fish cake on one of my orders. Padkemao noodle were all broken, was not cooked properly. It seems like they are using bad quality ingredients. That's not right. I reported this to grubhub and the restaurant owner called me. Her apology wasn't professional, she called me that I'm the bad customer. I'm posting a photo of the mold on the fish cake.<//Review>

Delicious food at very affordable prices and with a lot of variety. The space is very homey and unassuming, but the serving sizes are formidable and the staff extremely friendly. It's very easy to become a regular with their specials! And their drinks are fantastic.< /text>

I ordered food from here and did not get what I ordered. I called and told them what happened and explained that I got the wrong food and they HUNG UP ON ME! I tried calling back, but they DISCONNECTED their phones! I kept trying for the next 15 minutes until they finally decided to turn their phone back on...I questioned why they hung up on me and THE MAN SAYS “oh my god oh my god” AND HANGS UP AGAIN! I decided to drive to the restaurant to confront them and when I got there they acted like none of this ever happened but still remade the dish. I’ve never had such unprofessional service in my life I will never be coming back here.</Review>

Food is amazing, I'm not sure what this place does differently, but my order always tastes better when I get it here. Run by a family if I recall correctly. Parking outside does leave a little to be desired though.<//text>

Between the restaurant or doordash, someone can't not be trusted. Item missing from a 33 dollar order. Not okay at all< /text>

I really liked this place. The best Thai Food I have eaten since coming back from Thailand.

I also liked the staff. Cute and friendly. The meal was served quickly despite the hectic pace of the restaurant. They seemed to have many delivery orders.

The restaurant is in a rather strange old industrial building. Which could turn people off. But I would recommend giving it a try.</review>

<user_name>Sergey Chernioglo</user_name><Review>The food was GREAT and people working there are very friendly.  The location is a bit sketchy (I came there late in the evening and was surprised to find this restuarant in such a place where there is bunch of automotive shops and other businesses), but did not feel any danger, etc... The place it self is not an elegant or fancy place, but it has a small town mom and pop shop feeling and I personally tought it was very unique experience. I loved the food and my experience was good. I would have given 5 stars, but because of the location, I figured 4 stars might be more appropriate.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The food is very delicious. First time I try Thai food and the first time I went to this place. The prices are great considering they give you a good portion, and the taste was incredible. Seems like a family owned business, so everything is authentic. They cook it when you order.</review>

<Text>This place is so cool, very industrial.  I just bought a groupon (I know so yesterday) for them.  I've been driving past for years, trying to see if they were still open.  So I'm thrill they are still in business. They really need to get a better sign.  That said, the food is very good and not the usual fare.  I really like the spring rolls with the green dip.  And the atmosphere is cool also, reminds me of a cafeteria hidden away in a factory somewhere.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Excellent food tucked away in a quaint little spot. Highly recommend the entree #1 - super tasty bbq chicken, green papaya salad, sticky rice in a bamboo basket. awesome food and such a little gem. in a pretty shady part of town but it's definitely worth the trip!<//text>

Super friendly family, any given day of the week that you go you will meet the mother, father and daughter if a family business isn't something to support I don't know what is. The Pad Kee Mao, Pad Broccoli (which is delicious) and Kang Ga Rhee (sp?) are all house hold favorites.
Thai iced tea isn't overly sweet either.< /text>

Im a an x thai chef from a very authentic place in fresno called keothip. Tried this place out once before today. Orderd the nam tok recived something like larp.tooooooo sweet. Came in today and ordered the yellow curry and kao neo. The sticking rice had mold on it. And it was microwaved before served to me. When i brought it up tot he gentelman serving me he reasurred me it was not mold but i know what it was.... Yellow curry was pretty tasty. The roaches running along the wall not my favorite thing to see< /Text>

<text>Family operated restaurant with Mom, daughter, and son.  Am told they've been in business since August 2015.  Ample parking.  Open 10am-10pm.  Deliveries up to 9pm, if order is $30+.

Kinda a funky, Marin-ish, hippy-like atmosphere, although these people are certainly not hippies.

Enjoyed their calimari salad, although just don't expect a traditional leafy, western-style salad.  Order the brown rice and mix the two together.

VERY friendly service.

Good value.  Lots of seafood dishes.  Everything priced under $10.< /text></record>

I drive 15 mins just to get my haircut here. Not only are the people nice, but they give a customer experience you enjoy. It is nice when a hair stylist takes their time right? Given that it is more of a country feeling these locations are the best place's to go. Less people means more time. Which in return is not only a better haircut, but a more quality haircut.<//Text>

Quickly seated and served.  The stylist was able to ask the right questions to get me to explain what I wanted.  Very professional, but friendly at the same time.</Text>

Brought my daughter for her first hair cut.  Came out so uneven.  I could have done better on my own.  My daughter was well behaved and still, no reason for this at all. $20 for an awful haircut.  Will never return.< /Review>

Very clean , staff was welcoming both had grate attitudes... plus there a three legged dog who likes to come by and visit the store.  Dogs are always a plus in my book , of course she isn't allowed in the store.  She sure will hangout just outside , so you can say hi and bye on you're way in and out .< /Review>

There's a reason why people in the past make fun of each other for going to a once cheap and still unprofessional place with mostly newly graduated barber school workers. They're worked like fast food workers and are given a quota of only 17 minutes per customer. The penalty for going over is a loss in weekly work days. If you want the work done right and with care go to a real salon where you'll be treated fairly and not like a number. I gave up after the 2nd one kept messing up my hair, couldn't figure out how to do the job right, forgetful and will not under any circumstances hold an appointment time. Poor quality. Done.</text>

Typically good service.  Went in today and stylist was to do a haircut with shorter hair on on side and only trim rest.  There were distractions in the salon today.

The stylist pulled out electric clippers.  I kept saying the cut wasn't looking right.  She kept cutting.  Two clipper tools later my hair looked horrible. Have big meeting in 2 weeks.  Hopefully it grows out fast and can get a better cut from my regular stylist who was off.  Heartsick and really disappointed about the experience.  At least  they didn't charge me for messing up my hair.  🙄🤔😭🤮😡< /Text>

First time I ever got my hair chop off. Was nervous about it. The coolest thing ever. I'm glad I did it. I think the stylists name is Jamie She was so professional and she acknowledged new clients as they came in. Very impressed!<//text>

Nice, nice people. They do a great job. They're getting pricey but that's not the stylists fault. And since a lot of my head is barren land mass, I think I should get a discount. Kidding.</review>

Cut was okay.  Place was horribly kept.  Hair everywhere and dust buildup hanging from ceiling intake vents.  I think it's time to start looking for a new salon.  This place really needs to clean up its act.< /Review>

My son just received a five minute “haircut” from Brittany. It is the worst hair cut he has ever gotten. The fade is patchy and the edges are scraggly. She also didn’t say a single word to my son the entire time she was cutting his hair. To top the whole experience off, she didn’t clean any of the clippings off of his neck or ears. What a waste of money.< /Text>

<Text>Received a haircut from Brittany and I told her to cut my hair to my jawline and it is way shorter and she made my bangs uneven I am never going back. I also told her to straighten my hair she charged me an extra 10 dollars and she didn’t even straighten the whole thing, she straightened the top that’s all.< /Text>< Resp>

<Text>Place is OK. Hair cuts for us both were nothing special. But what do you expect from a place like this. For $20.00  you get a sprayed wet head and scissor cut. That's about it. Your head will be wet when you walk out.<//Text><GmapID>0x80d958d029640bf7:0x8fd73770c74d9eb9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If you're searching for a new salon, make I Nail Spa your choice! The salon is beautiful and supper clean.  The staff are attentive welcoming and will make your whole experience amazing, from begin to end
You're greeted with a smile and water as soon as you step in as if you're already a regular client.
I came in for a full set and a pedicure, my technical ( sorry I forgot her name ) was thorough and great conversationalist and most important part my nail came out look amazing. Will be going here from now now on
P/s Their color collection is insane - TON of gel and regular polish.< /Text>< pictures>

I went to get my nails done today and saw that they got new dipping powder with over 300 different colors. The colors are very pretty. The salon is also very clean and the staffs are very nice. I also tried the Hawaii coconut pedicure and I LOVED it! It was very relaxing and I will definitely be coming back and get it again!<//Review>

They did such an amazing job on my pedí and dip mani today!  I was in heaven with my massage!!! I’ve been getting pedicures for 20+ years and the massage along with their attention to detail ... spectacular! Plus the place is clean and very much of a modern chic vibe.  👍🏼👍🏼</review>

The staff were very friendly. The shop was clean and the price was good. Very relaxing atmosphere with spa type music. I tried 2 other shops before I found this one and was very disappointed with both of them. Inagar Nail Spa is farther from my home but so worth the drive. I left a wonderful shop where I lived in the LA area and worried I would have a hard time finding a great place here. I'm glad I found this shop.<//Text>

<review>This is the first time in many years I have had my nails done.  I am very pleased with my visit.  I called and was able to get in within an hour.  The location was clean, friendly and quiet.  Very pleasant. I had dipped nails done and there were so many colors to pick!  The woman who did my nails was great.  It was a great experience and I love my nails.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x809b21edcf58cbdb:0xaaa2ec9cf2570ff0<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've been looking for a nail salon in roseville for so long and I have found it !!!  I've gone to so many in the past that say they're really good but the results aren't what I wanted  But this place is amazing. My new nail  set is out of my comfort zone but they nailed what I had in mind.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Today was my first time, ever, visiting Inagar nail salon and I'm so happy about my experience there. I've never had acrylic nails before and this experience has set my expectations very high for any other salon I might visit. I had my nails done by Kate and she was amazing! I will be coming back again, maybe for a pedicure next time, and, bringing friends. 😊</Review>< GmapID>

<review>I love Inagar Nails Spa! I have only tried their pedicures on 4 occasions so far and every time has been better than the last. Most importantly, the spa is spotless and the staff do their best to keep it in pristine condition. The tub liners in the tubs are a great addition and I noticed the staff thoroughly scrubbing the tubs at the end of the night. That's the kind of cleanliness I look for! In terms of the pedicures themselves, I have tried the Hawaiian Coco and the Green Tea ones thus far and both are superior. They use real ingredients in their spa materials such as real edible coconut milk or real green tea, which makes the pedicures feel healthier for my skin to take in. It definitely seems like the staff take pride in the quality of their spa materials and I appreciate that. I will continue to be a regular customer here and hope Inagar maintains its' wonderful service, professionalism, and high standards. Thank you!< /review>< Name>

We love coming here, the staff is so friendly and welcoming. My daughter and I come in frequently.  We never feel rushed they take their time,  give extra long massages and the attention to detail is amazing. My daughter always wants specific designs and they always come out perfectly. Give this place a try you will not be disappointed< /text>

My first time trying this salon.  I came with my two daughters that live in the area.  We foind this salon on yelp.  The salon itself is clean & their products are of good quality. Thyla did an excellent job with my powder dip manicure and I got the basic pedicure.   I will return when I visit again in December.<//text>

First time here and I was very satisfied! Thyla did my acrylic fill and it was amazing. She took her time and fix what the last salon messed up. I can truly appreciate nail salon such as this place. I recently moved to CA from the East Coast and hadn’t found a salon I really enjoyed getting my nails done at. They have a wide variety of Dip Powders and Shelac Gel polish. I’m a definitely a satisfied customer. Thanks Thyla!!<//review>

09/01/18 Still loving this Nails Spa! Went in today for my last summer color nails before I start looking at all the Fall Dipping Powder colors they have. Love this place, just love!

This shop is under new Ownership, and just re-opened as Inagar Nails, about a ten days ago. I went here for the Natural Dipping Powder nails, and they were also doing a special of Dipping Powder nails and a free pedi. I recently started getting Dipping Powder nails and my fav nail tech doesn’t do Dipping Powder nails, so I thought I’d give Inagar Nails a try. So glad I came here. It was quiet , w/ soothing music. The Pedi was nice, and I love the Dipping Powder manicure. I will be back.</review>

The 69w passed me by on soquel and 41st. Called customer service and got no help. The lady kept getting confused about what buses stopped there. I sat in the sun for a hour and now have to go to the ER. I'm disabled with photo sensitivity issues. Here is a pic of the schedule at that stop. They swear it doesn't stop there even though I have caught it there in the past.<//Text>

<name>Auxi Wolfy< /name><text>Not really reliable if you’re going to school, work, or an appointment. The schedule is a mess and all over the place and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Their banner ad says, “Dump the pump, take public transit” (or something like that). Save yourself the hassle in relying on a broken bus system and just drive your car or take an Uber if you don’t have one. I literally had to wait an hour and a half to get to SC from Scott’s Valley from the SV transit center.</text>< pictures>

The SC Metro has rising above my expectations during this pandemic. In March when this all started I found the transit busses a safe haven when I stepped on to them. The new busses are better designed for adapting to Covid19 standards than the old ones. They still are meeting their expectations. Thank you to the drivers for being here when we needed you. ✌️< /text>

Unreliable bus system, their bus schedule is more like an orientative bus arrival. Their customer service isn't good either. Consider convincing 3 people to hop in a Uber with you if you take the 17 bus.< /Text>

Late more often than not, in my experience. Today by 20 minutes, which frankly is unacceptable but not really rare. Drivers are courteous, so there's that.</Text>

<review>I got kicked out for yelling “if Young metro don’t trust you imma shoot ya” over and over again. Which is crazy I’m doing a service. A few days later some guy at the metro station said he liked his music but he didn’t really trust young metro and then he got shot and it’s like you know I tried to warn you why wouldn’t you listen to me? I wasn’t surprised or sad when I heard that news.
Nice thing about this place is when they kick you out you can go to San Jose.
Wait
That’s a bad thing

Had a great cold brew coffee here. Was just passing through and needed a pick me up. The god behind the counter had an infectious smile and the whole staff was super friendly. Consistent quality throughout most Starbucks and people can hate on them all they want but they make some dang old cold brew. Cheers!<//review>

< Review>
Hit this location on a Sunday afternoon and found no lines or crowds (making it a little oasis in the city).

Super friendly folks, coffees done right, and lots of seating made our visit a pleasant one.

As other reviewers have noted, there are no plug-in power stations. We weren't in need so it wasn't an issue. There are power pads on the bar.<//Review>

Coffee is good of course.  Bathroom is beyond filthy.  Urine on the floor.  Sticky floor.  Toilet paper wadded up, wet, and stick on the walls.  I mentioned this to the staff who just shrugged their shoulders and did nothing.<//review>

<Text>Pro: Nitro cold brew in the house!
Con: It feels like an older store, a bit dingy looking. It gets the job done but I probably wouldn't choose to come back here over other options in the area.<//Text>< Pictures>

Busy, like every Starbucks in SF or anywhere. The staff remains friendly and the seating area is pretty clean considering the traffic through here. The restroom is challenging because they offer their restrooms to the general public. While I appreciate their goodwill, but they need to maintain them better and possibly even offer more or larger restrooms.< /Text>

It was mid-afternoon and the only coffee option was Pike Place. No Christmas blend or Veranda. This seems to be a problem with most Starbucks though. The staff seemed completely disorganized. The tables were dirty. The trash was overflowing. My friend got a coffee cake and there was some kind of paper baked into it.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

This is my favorite Starbucks in the downtown ares. The staff is polite and service is fast. They have tons of seating and is roomie. They do have times they are extremely busy and that is when there is a convention is happening in the area. Even when they are busy service is still fast and not a long wait. The only downfall is if you stop there for a drink and sit on the laptop or need to plug in a phone they have no outlets to use at this location.<//text>

It's a warm place to sit down, if it's not too crowded which is usually between 7:00am-10:00am and 3:00pm-7:00pm weekdays which has been my experience. I usually get a hot tea and a croissant warmed up and use my phone while it's charging. Only downside to that is this Store has eliminated most are their outlets not sure why.....?< /review>

typically Starbucks is Starbucks but the location at 3rd and market in San Francisco is a different story.  this Starbucks is typically very dirty understaffed, there's always a line and it's very dark in the store. I typically visit the Starbucks very early in the morning around 6:00 a.m.

there are also often a lot of homeless people in the store at this hour in varying states of filth and sanity. but it is San Francisco so maybe that's to be expected.<//text>

<Time>1505322825423</Time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I've never felt so compelled to write a bad review !The reason I frequent Starbucks is simple - decent Internet connectivity and plug points for charging, aside from some decent coffee. This is supposed to be the "Starbucks experience" after all. If it were just for the coffee, there are far better indie places out there. And hence I find it unacceptable when this location seals their plug points so that patrons cannot charge their devices.

More so, I would have loved to smack the staff for their downright condescending attitude!  I got a Protein Box and asked for cutlery - the looks and attitude shown by the staff was as if I had stolen a Protein Box! I was turned down for Salt, Pepper and Sriracha with zero eye-contact and curt replies.

Store manager - kindly take note. Do not ruin the "Starbucks experience".<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Love the service here. Unlike other Starbucks, this location offers the best customer service where they go the extra mile to describe what the coffee offering.  Plus they have a Clover machine.< /Review>< pics>

Just had an amazing experience. From the moment I walked in, I wish I had gotten names! The gentleman who took my order was welcoming and genuine, he sincerely asked about my day and invited me back. He wished me luck on the job interviews I was on my way to. The ladies were helping with cleaning duties but quickly attended to customers before allowing a line to form. My drink was made perfect, the atmosphere was clean and inviting, and I will be back to this location. From experience working in food and customer service I know people are quick to comment negative experiences, but I have to give credit when and where credit is due, And it's definitely due here! Thanks ya'll!< /text>

Pretty dirty and no place to plug in. Trash cans were overflowing. This location has a bad homeless problem, which makes it uncomfortable to hang out in. Not trying to be a dbag, but you can't really meet a date here or take your mom for a cup of coffee. Bathroom was kinda scary and offputting.<//Review>

Ok... I normally like Starbucks, but I went in this morning and ordered a large tea and a bagel with cream cheese.  They totally forgot my tea (I had to remind them after standing around waiting for a good 10 minutes) and then, after I left and got into the office, realized that my bagel with cream cheese has no cream cheese.  However, they did remember to put in a knife to spread my non-existent cream cheese.  Maybe I'm supposed to use it as a stirrer for the tea that they forgot too... The only saving grace of this experience is that I don't actually live here, so I don't have to go to this Starbucks again.  Ugh.</Review>

Starbucks, you just make coffee here like all the other Starbucks, but only they actually take your order.  There was a family and one person ahead of me.  After waiting over 10 minutes to order as the barista kept messing around and the line continued to grow and grown.  5 more minutes pasted and he's still chatting with their people about what they're doing in town.  We're still waiting for him to take their order, the other guy who we though was going to open the other register joined in on their conversation.  I got sick of waiting and just left.</review>

I'm working in the area and needed to use the bathroom a couple times. Drinks and food I purchased were on par, but the few times I went in there I had to deal with some horribly unsavory people that would stay in the bathroom for 10+ minutes. I feel bad for the courteous workers that had to put up with the crackheads coming in.<//Review>

I've been working on a big accounting project lately and came here early AM to get on with it; given i had short sleep the night before closed my eyes and tried to have a power nap. That's until an oblivious and obnoxious waitress came over and woke me up briskly, with the kind of pat you give to a TV to see if it's working.
Moreover the CHAIRS are something from a western movie and they replaced all couches with wooden, scant nightmares of a chairs.<//Text>< Pictures>

If, like me, you customize your drink do mobile ordering. I specifically said no syrup, 2 Splenda, no h2o. What I received instead was just an unsweetened green tea because the kid wasn't following. It's not hard, that much I know because I order it ALL the time at every starbucks and target starbucks I've been to. If they were busy it might be understandable, but it's dead empty in here--only about a dozen of us sitting down.

My chicken artichoke was good, as always, as it should be since it's shipped from corporate. I'll still be coming back to starbucks 'cause momma need her fix, but I might have the guys at this branch show me what they've written *prior* to me paying.

Oh, and on this visit 9/7/17, their bathroom is out of order. I really should've stuck to my laurel village sb...No issues there 'cept maybe not getting a plug...< /Text>

Very long line and the whole place was so busy that staff were not able to keep up and keep the place clean. It was ok to take away but wouldnt sit down as seating was scarce and very messy. The toilet was also unclean.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I pretty much can't live without Starbucks. I love the pike place blend, caramel macchiato, pumpkin spice latte, and mocha frappuchino. I also love just a simple americano on most mornings. The baristas are always super nice and willing to customize your drink however you want it.

Want to try something out of the box? Order a captain crunch or snickers frapp! Research Starbucks secret menu online for more suggestions.<//review>< pics>

<text>I don't usually write reviews, but felt I had to after my visit to this starbucks today.   I ordered a blueberry oatmeal, and after a short wait was told that they have no blueberry oatmeal.  A supervisor overheard the barista telling me this and instantly came over, asked me if i minded waiting for her to go and get me a free drink voucher, or if i would like to get a pastry on the house.  I opted for the free drink voucher, however whilst i was waiting they also offered me a free drink (giving me a venti when i only asked for a grande) IN ADDITION to the drink voucher that came soon after.

So all I wanted was some oatmeal, I came away with oatmeal (minus blueberries), a free venti drink and a free drink voucher - that's pretty good customer service!

This is a highly trafficked starbucks so for this kind of customer service in such a busy area is astounding.</text><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>
