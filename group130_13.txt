<review>I used to go here alot, they used to have good service and good employees a while back, now I watch a waitress flirt with two guys while I've asked for fresh coals twice when the hookah wasn't good from the start. The hookah used to be alot more affordable. The place now has more booths... they are going for profit. I gave an extra star because another employee fixed it</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Janae was cool great service, nice smile. Food was great. Very tasty and tons of flavor. Pretty affordable. We ate burgers and onion rings. I had 2 cocktails and we had hookah it was $72.00 total for a Wednesday night. Music was popping. Twerking music all night. I bet it's live on the weekends.</text>

<rating>4< /rating><pics>None< /pics><Text>I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the prices. Definitely charging waaayyy to much for custom mixes. As someone who's worked at hookah lounges in the past, definitely should have staff learn how to setup a better hookah from someone highly experienced. Doesnt make sense to charge that much and it feel like you smoking more air than actual shisha. The drinks were great and the atmosphere is solid and captivating though. Bartenders definitely quick and efficient. More of a payday spot, but overall I like it.<//Text>< Name>

Went for a cocktail here on friday the 26th and ordered 3 drinks and signed a tab for 22 dollars. Later ordered the same and it stated the same. Checked my bill and somehow got charged over 120 for my order. No way to contact management. Phone number rings non stop. Highly recommend to go other places<//Text>

where do we start? I'm from LA and big hookah guy, so we came here on a trip and boy this hookah lounge sucks. Who uses quick lite charcoal inside a hookah bar ? and  hookah bars are not usually known for integrity but having one price on the menu and charging another is just on a different level<//Review>

< Review>
About 4 years ago I came here for New Years night. Some friends and I were smoking hookah and dancing when a fat, mexican bouncer grabbed me, pulled me outside, and accused me of distributing weed inside the place. He told me to hand it over or else the cops would be called. At the time I was serving in the Navy and told him I couldn't smoke weed or have it for my job wouldn't let me. He had the wrong guy. He kept accusing me and even grabbed my arm. After my friend stepped in he let me go and caught two arabic guys inside the place doing it instead of me. I want to personally challenge that bouncer to a fight if anyone reads this. Come and fight me please. I want to hear from you. I want justice.<//Review>

<Review>Only a 1 Star because I can’t go any lower!!! Went to Casablanca lounge tonight and was having a good time until the bill came. Had hookah and drinks, then asked for the bill and the waitress said it was around $163 dollars which I thought was a little high. I asked for a receipt and she said it would be emailed to me and that the bill was higher because of the hookah I ordered and the automatic 15% gratuity and taxes. Me being a educated man, I did the math and it still did not add up. I wait d for the receipt and it never came. I asked again and she stated “Oh, it’s emailed at the end of the night”. I then asked for a printed copy of the receipt, and the waitress stated, “the printer is broken”. After I was persistent, she then stated she would talk to the manager and see what she could do. A few minutes later she returns with a receipt. Upon looking over the receipt, what she did was added an additional tip to the bill without my permission and because they is he iPad/tablet, you don’t see it. I asked to speak to a manager and the waitress stated, “ she is busy”. She never actually spoke to a manager and was trying to defuse the situation because she knew she was caught and wrong. She then offered to pay me cash from her pocket so that she did not have to cancel the transaction, which would raise some red flags. The waitress committed credit card fraud and I suspect that she if not many of the staff has been doing this. They are placing additional tip amounts on the card without the customer knowing. She claims she doesn’t know ho it got there but after speaking to other servers that’s not true. So, if you go to Casablanca and “KAYLA” is your waitress, check your bill!!! I will contact the owner tomorrow to see how to handle this because it is criminal in nature and against the law! She purposely tried to rip us off and then tried to lie and keep us from seeing the paper copy and speaking to a manager. I recommend not going to this establishment!< /Review>< date>

We went to this restaurant for some drinks one night after dinner at pampas. We were just walking by when we greats some music. The music drew us in and we walked in to the restaurant and ordered a couple drinks. The restaurant has great ambience and live music sometimes. I loved sitting outside the restaurant and enjoying the drinks while also enjoying the live music and dancing. Would definitively love to come back and try their food sometime.<//Text>

I enjoyed Three Seasons very much. I am vegetarian and my family shared 4 dishes- all of which ranged from good to excellent. The crispy veg roll was good(taro in it made it special). The noodles and fried tofu were really good. The noodles had lots of sprouts and the flavor was delicious. The fried tofu was crispy and the coating was very well seasoned. Now comes the amazing veg. curry- I was skeptical but  quite honestly blown away by how well this dish was. Firstly they had very interesting vegetables- brussels sprouts, okra, 2 kinds of cauliflower- all of which were cooked just right, good quality veggies and absorbed the curry flavor. Needless to say, I'll be back. The ambiance was also very pleasant. You get what you pay for!(would reduce half star for the salad that came with crispy rolls which smelled a bit of fish sauce- but this was on the side).</review>

Nice venue.  It's a bar setting for a Vietnamese Fusion cuisine.  Fast service.  Duck rolls was very good.  Garlic noodles can be better.  The pho is tasty but not authentic.  Overall it is a good place to get a taste of Vietnamese food though not authentic.< /Text>

Initial impression was loved the outside seating and location as well as ambiance. Service was decent, waitresses had pleasant attire but shorts were quite short. Food was decent as well, too much salt for my liking however. My friend and I ordered the lemongrass chicken, garlic noodles and eggplant to share. As well as two speciality drinks for a $70 bill. Overall not wowed but decent place.< /Review>

This place is really underrated.  They have my favorite pho soup in town.  Also really like the sea bass, and the shrimp salad with peppers and mango.  A little pricey, but worth it.  Good date spot.< /Text>

<review>I heard Three Seasons was good from a friend but was pretty disappointed after dining here.  The food was just OK but was extremely overpriced.  Even if portions are small, I would expect the restaurant to compensate in taste or quality. Unfortunately, this is there Three Seasons fell short.

I won't complain about the $9 for 6 oysters special -- not a bad deal, but, the rolls were definitely overpriced.  We shared the traditional spring rolls and crispy rolls which were not outstanding.  I've definitely had superior or comparable rolls for about half the price and hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese places. We also had the garlic noodles which were pretty bland and the chicken salad which was nothing special.

Service was ok -- I think our waitress forgot about us after we ordered and we had to flag down another server to order more food.  This place has a beautiful atmosphere and the outdoor seating was lovely but I'm afraid I won't be back due anytime soon.  I'm not willing to pay extra just for a nice atmosphere so hopefully they can step up the quality of their dishes.<//review>< pictures>

<name>Kirill Safin<//name><time>1511862605570</time><rate>5</rate><Review>Highly recommend Three Seasons, it's probably the best Vietnamese food around. We go in regularly for the Pho, which is a much higher quality Pho than you get anywhere else. The spring rolls are also excellent, and the cauliflower "shot" is delicious and surprising. The environment is also very nice and the venue is beautiful, both inside and out.< /Review>< pictures>

Definitely errs on the side of fancy (and a bit pricey). The food was good, though there weren't too many vegetarian options. I remember the garlic noodles fondly.<//Review>

We had the duck spring roll, seafood pot stickers, green papaya salad with shrimp, garlic noodles, pork baby back ribs, and happy buns.
The only dish that fell short was the pot stickers - they were kind of clammy, and the filling was "meh."
Everything else was really good.  The papaya salad was fresh and crisp; the garlic noodles rich and hearty; the ribs were finger-lickin' good.  The happy buns were so good we ordered them twice!
Our server was eager and helpful.  We had an eight o'clock show time and he made sure to get us out in time.
The fruity drinks perfectly complimented our meal.</review><date>1404363484082< /date><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

Okay French Vietnamese, but not great. I'm willing to pay higher prices (e.g. Xanh in Mountain View) but the food at Three Seasons isn't worth the extra spend. The dishes are mostly bland, and there aren't any enough good vegetable offerings.< /Review>

<user>112704870730510086957< /user><review>Nice ambiance & service. Ambiance is better than at Tamarine - the other Vietnamese fusion place in Palo Alto - for one reason because tables are not so closely spaced. The food continues to be excellent. There are many vegetarian & vegan items. I have had vegetarian spring rolls with shots of asparagus soup or cauliflower bisque (this is a great item), garlic noodles (made with egg but those who have tried it love it), papaya salad (very nice & not to strong in taste like some other places that serve this), curry veggies (very good, not too spicy, a nice variety of vegetables, eggplant in coconut sauce (the best item), Spinach noodles (good), lemon tofu (good), green beans (good), crispy vegetarian rolls (okay), tofu eggplant satay (okay) & spicy okra (okay) Drinks: the virgin guavati & lemonade/passion fruit iced tea were good. Our friends loved the creme brulee but we liked the chocolate fondant as well as the mango sorbet, vanilla sorbet & coconut ice cream. The fried banana was good. The teas & coffees are also nice. The restaurant recently redid its interior - which continues to be elegant in style.<//review></record>

<Review>This used to be a 4 star restaurant for me - I've been here numerous times in the past years - their Valentine's Day dinner, parties of 2 to 6, and even birthdays.  And who can deny that their rolls are good?

But, success has gone to their head and I'm sad to say that they've lost my business.  Why?

- Didn't count my reservation with opentable, causing me to "prove" that I went to the restaurant with open table, which is always a hassle
- Took over an hour to bring us our main courses
- Slow water service, virtually non-existent waiter
- Their portions have gotten smaller, while prices have gone up...their New Zealand 5-spice lamb was one of my favorites, but it's more expensive and smaller than ever.  Really disappointing
- incorrect items were placed on our bill
- Dirty, broken dishes set at our table

Anyway, if you have money to blow, get the rolls and get out.< /Review><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<username>Ramey Echt< /username><Rating>2</Rating><text>The outdoor space is beautiful and the seating is comfortable and nice.  The inside is nice as well... obviously a historic building of some sort.

The food left A LOT to be desired.  Portions are small, flavors are bland (especially for vietnamese food), and choices aren't that great.  Food presentation was nice. As others have stated, prices are definitely expensive for the quantity and quality of the food.

We had Vegetarian Spring Rolls with a sauce that was nothing to write home about. The asparagus soup shots that came with the dish was a nice touch.  The Chicken Satay was okay, but the peanut sauce totally fell short.  Finally, the grapefruit/jicama salad was a disaster.  Full of jicama, not much grapefruit, and a total of 4 cashews in the dish.  After those disappointing dishes, we gave up.

If you're looking for a nice place to relax and don't care much about the food quality, you will enjoy.  If you're looking for good vietnamese food, I suggest looking elsewhere.<//text>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) I often went out with someone who came on a business trip. Japanese people also like Asian foods, the heart and body that are tired of jet lag and American food.

<userid>116764000062963927283< /userid><Text>I'm a Charter Member and have been using EagleRider since 2017. One of the main reasons I continue is the awesome service I receive each and every time I ride.

Brandon is the manager and the guy always insures my bikes are in perfect condition when I pick-up. Not once have I ever had any type of mechanical issues in the dozens of times I've ridden. Plus, the bikes absolutely shine each and every time. Such a great feeling riding a bike and have all the chrome shine(especially when you don't have to polish it!).

It is such a rare experience to actually have an employee act like an owner that when it happens you notice. Kudo's to Brandon for running such a tight ship and actually taking care of his customers. I remain a loyal customer because of his actions.< /Text>< Rate>

Great experience. Brandon was awesome to deal with. Check out was fast and easy and check in was smooth and fast too. First time renter with Eagle rider and because of the way Brandon treated me I will be a repeat customer with this location. Awesome experience, will do it again and would recommend anyone thinking about to pull the trigger!<//Review>

- Ease of renting. 5⭐ 's. We decided late Saturday night to rent a Harley on Sunday. After looking at all the options to rent through different agencies we choose HDSD (EagleRider SD) because of the varieties of bikes, you're guaranteed the quality and assurance of riding a top notch HD motorcycle, plus all the equipment is included.
- In store experience 5+5⭐'s.  I wish I could name everyone in this store because they're all awesome! Down to earth, happy, helpful, bike loving people.  Brandon and Ryan are the reason we had such a great day.  Brandon handled the rental, did the service check, walked me through the bike from wheel to wheel, broke out a map and we talked through the route and what would enhance the ride, and got us out the door. He also checked us back in and we talked about the different styles HD is carrying as a comparison for what we rode   Ryan walked with us around the shop, pulled up maps on his phone, and made some suggestions to the route to make sure we had the most scenic ride possible.  No way we would have seen what we did on our trip without him.
- The bike. 5 ⭐'s.  We rented a Street Glide Grand Touring bike. It really doesn't get much better.  It handled like a luxury performance vehicle, no surprise it's Harley Davidson! We took the scenic route up to Julian and back.  Lots of curves, fast highway straight aways, and the ever present cross winds in the valley and we cruised right through them all with a smile. Lots of storage space, comfortable seats, my better half was in heaven on the back seat.
- Overall 5+5+5⭐'s.  No clue why we haven't done this sooner.  It's great to have the option to try out different motorcycles and away for a day or a weekend in a completely different way then driving or flying somewhere and there's nothing like the experience.  We WILL be coming back and when it's time to finally decided on a bike to call our own, you can guarantee it'll be from the EagleRider San Diego family< /Review>< gmap_id>

I have rented a Street Glide for the 4th time.  I never write reviews at first point of cpntact.  But I must say i am extremely inpressed.  Brandon is professional and very courteous.  He has answered all of my questions and even has gone  the extra mile to teach me about the bike and safety while riding.  Brandon wore a covid safe mask the whole time through all of out interactions.   He is an asset to your company and in my perspective has achieved all of the Customer Service skills to optimum preformance.
Regards

Single or multiple day rentals. Rode a 2017 RoadMaster with 8000 miles. Bike was great. Had it for three day rental. A week later rented Indian Chief Vintage with 2,800 miles for 24 hours.<//text>

Great experience with quick, to the point, check-in & out, good rides to Mt Palomar & around, downtown attractions & Little Italy for suppers. Two days of predictably good weather & lane splitting when freeways had to be joined for connections.</text>

<Text>Highly reccomend renting with Eagle Rider San Diego! Great professional staff who are all very knowledgeable about their rental fleet! This eagle rider is even located inside the San Diego Harley Davidson dealership, so I got to drool over all of their new inventory too.

Vince and Pedro we’re both super helpful and even offered a full tour of the dealership! Great group of people working here. Can’t wait to come back< /Text>< pics>

<text>Ya gotta love being able to rent a bike in a different city and do a tour. Motorcycle riding is where it's at. But it's hard to carry a couple of weeks need on saddle bags. This is a good happy medium way of traveling and riding on the same vacation.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>While visiting from Germany my friend got a day off to have me ride with him in SD county. So I headed to Eagle Rider yesterday evening. I wasn't sure if the trip was gonna happen and a little bit tired after spending all day in LA. So Anitra told me to not sweat it if I'm tired and not 100% sure and come back in the morning. We wanted to start the tour at 9 and Eagle Rider didn't open until 10. However, Anitra told me that she would come in a little earlier to get me on the road. This morning I headed to Eagle Rider after my buddy confirmed and Anitra was there to attend me. She walked me through the process of the rental and took my data, German driver license and my card for payment. Made sure I knew everything I needed about the bike, some routes, and the return. We spend a wonderful day in SD county. I even got a new 2018 Fatboy, the bike I'm actually looking to buy. The bike was impeccable, the ride smooth. Came back at 6:40 PM 20 minutes before closing with a full tank of gas. Anitra was there for the return, as promised. She showed genuine interest in my experience and was very kind and professional. The next time I'm in town I will definitely come back here. Highly recommend!<//Review>< GmapID>

I did not have a pleasant experience here dealing with Brennan.  I booked a street 500 Thursday morning around 5am.  They never asked me for my m license endorsement info.  I've been riding since 2008 but where I live, no one cares about that, so I only have a permit.  When I called at 1230 to tell them I was late (coming in from out of town) they told me i need an M license and there was absolute no way they could work with me.  They refused to give me a refund after holding the bike for less than 12 hours and Brennan acted all tough like he was the big boss there but couldn't do a simple return.  He pushed me that I needed that and that there was nothing we could do to get the situation right.  I'm having my last ride with my brother in law in the military and wanted to ride around oceanside with him.  I asked him if my brother in law could borrow the bike, I'll ride his and I'll return the loaner tomorrow.  He said no way and chastised me for not reading the fine print.

I should note that back in Chicago I have a 2019 street bob and had a great experience at Chicago harley.  Eagle rider is not a small business.  Telling me that he held the bike for me and that's why there's no refund is ridiculous.  12 hours?  With a full stock of bikes? Ok if it was a mom and pop operation I might see that if they only had a few bikes but dont tell me that someone was dying for that bike and you had no others.

I would give one star but they gave me a store credit to eagle rider which is pretty much useless to me since they won't rent to me.<//review>

We rented a Harley for one day, coming in from Minnesota.   We dealt with Anitra and she could not have been more helpful about the bike itself and various route options to get the best ride for our limited time.   Best experience I've had at the many Eagle Rider facilities I've been to.</text>

<Text>I'm a frequent renter at Eagle Rider in Orlando, FL. This was my first experience at the San Diego store. I requested a glossy black Street Glide with a removable passenger backrest, removable back luggage rack, and electronic cruise control. I also requested a pick-up from my downtown hotel. Due to a canceled flight, I had to reschedule the pickup time on last minute notice. The staff was great, overall the experience was great. The pickup was fast and smooth. Sheri in the office was awesome. Docked a star because the bike they gave me did not have electronic cruise. Bummer, but a small thing at the end of the day. I will use them again. I highly recommend using there services. Ask them about the "smugglers run" (a ride Sheri recommended. It was a blast!</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Went there for a rental and had the pleasure of dealing with Kenon and Anitra. They made the experience even better than it could’ve been. They walked me through the process and helped me find the perfect bike. Made the day epic.
Needless to say I’ll be back again and again. Thanks you guys.<//Review>

This is an amazing membership program and I have been extremely impressed with their customer service and the overall experience. The team is very knowledgeable and helpful, the bikes are in great condition, and you cannot beat the price. If you are looking to ride from time to time and don't want all the hassle of owning a bike, this is the BEST membership you can buy. Happy riding!<//Review>

<Text>This was a great experience. People were helpful. I contact the shop before renting to have info about Supplemental Liability Insurance and they were happy to help. The team is very friendly, they gave us good tips where to cruise around San Diego and they are not there with a stop watch to check the second. The bike had some very (very!) minor problem and they were happy to be informed about it. This gave me the feeling they very much like to take care of their bikes to provide a good experience to their customers. I wish we had some more time to keep longer the bike. We had only two days (beginning of November) and made only a short tour: Sand Diego, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, San Diego. My only feed-back is to consider to allow returning the bike later than 4pm. 4 pm fells a bit too "in the middle of the day".

I can only recommend the place!

Cheers,

Marco</Text></record></dataset><record>

Would give ten stars if I could. Best rates in town. Best customer service EVER. And the EagleRider program is off the hook--EVERYBODY should do it.

Got a great bike at a super-cheap rate. Had so much fun, and they even worked with us on repairs after we dropped the bike on the dirt.

Super-friendly before and after rentals. People there are excited about bikes and excited about you enjoying your bike. Couldn't ask for a better experience.</Review>

I have rented several bikes with Eagle Rider this year. This was by far the best experience. The bike I reserved was ready to go when I got there. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Will be going back soon! Thanks a lot EagleRider.</review>

<Review>Seamless experience from reserving the rental to returning the bikes at the end of the day.  They were in good shape, just what we wanted, and the weather cooperated.  The employees were uniformly helpful and friendly, and gave us the AMA discount without hassle.  This was the first time we rented a bike, but it won't be the last.  Highly recommended.< /Review>< Pics>

Decided on a 6 day self directed tour out of San Diego,Feb 9,2014 all arrangements via e-mail. Picked up Road King as promised, bike performed flawlessly, all accommodations were first rate, no issues. Kudos to Eagle Rider San Diego for great service. This is the second package I have rented from Eagle Rider, both experiences have been very positive, would not hesitate to recommend.</review>

If I could give zero stars for this company I would. They allowed me to rent a bike online, charged my credit card immediately and sent me a confirmation email with no language regarding potential inventory availability issues. THREE days later they send me an email saying the vehicle was not available. I had already made plans and it was a rental for a birthday present for my boyfriend. They offered no solution! Absolutely the worst customer experience I have very had. DO NOT RENT from them!<//review>

I am a very frequent eagle rider renter, from AZ to NYC.  I went in here yesterday to reserve a bike and was refused service. The reason? "the staff was in a meeting." There were several employees working the floor, I guess we're all too incompetent to even remotely help me or take my info. They told me to come back later; not so logistically easy when you're on the other side of San Diego. This defies the definition of "customer service"
I rented from 360 Motorcycles instead who were more than glad to help me.<//Text>

I rented a red HD Soft Tail Firefighters Edition here. This was my first,  so the staff walked me through the process and answered all my queries patiently,  and mind you,  I'd lots of questions.

Check-in and check-out was pretty smooth, and the rates are amazing. Booked over the phone,  and  i was out of the place in 15 mins. Will definitely come back here, next time I'm in SD.< /Review>

<Text>I rented motorcycles already several times at multiple places. With the service staff and the quality of the motorcycle in this store, I was very much satisfied. The staff is friendly, the motorcycle was in very good condition (I rented a Harley-Davidson). Booking in the internet and picking up the bike worked well. The gasoline fill level was approximately 3/4 of the volume and I was only expected to return it that way. Since I did not go to a gas station, I was charged a small amount of additional dollars, which is acceptable. I felt very secure and can definitely recommend this place!< /Text>< user>

< Review>
I have rented from EagleRider twice.  Both experiences were excellent.  The motorcycles were top notch, service was excellent, and they are located close to the airport which was useful since I was coming in from New England.< /Review>

<Review>Poor customer service. Called to confirm availability, 20 mins later I arrive, the staff was passive with me and just said everything was sold out. I would have appreciated knowing that before the drive. Also asked for any recommendations on other places, they said they knew none. Luckily another company I called who was sold out, recommeneded to to Rentys in SD.</Review>< pics>

<text>This is the worst service experience I have ever had with a dealership. The first problem is their phone system. When you call you are routed through the LA corporate HQ who in turn routes you to San Diego, but often gets misrouted to some other city or state. If you are so lucky to reach the right location, you will find the service to be confused, unmotivated and cavalier. I brought my Indian Chief Vintage in for service and they estimated two weeks and have had my bike for three months - seriously. What a drag dealing with these guys.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I rented a Triumph Bonneville from the San Diego location, and it was a great experience overall. I didn't have a reservation, but the bike was available and I was riding within 10 minutes. Thank you!< /Review>

They've accomadated me when jve shown up an hour later than scheduled and hooked me up by reserving lowrider and sick bikes s for me for days on end.

We were greeted right away and the bike was ready to go in short order.  Sherry was great with all our questions and she got us on our way very quickly.  Much better service here than in the SFO office.  Highly recommend using the San Diego location for your rental bike needs.

We did a one way rental from San Diego to San Francisco on an Electra Glide from September  17th to the 20th.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>December 8th we were in San Diego and made a last minute decision to rent 3 Harleys for a quick 7 hour ride up and back to The Rock Store for lunch. We had an excellent rental experience with a very fast check in and out. As we were leaving one of our group was uncomfortable with the seat on the Soft Tail. They offered to switch him up to a Road King but suggested they first remove the passenger seat which he did not need. That solved the problem and he was able to stick with the Softtail- which is the bike he really wanted to ride. While we were there I noticed several bikes were getting backrests, racks and windshields added or removed to meet the requests of renters. It's tough to beat that kind of service and caring!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This was our 7th year using EagleRider.  We tour around the States and for this trip we chose the EagleRider in San Diego because of their positive reviews. From the moment I made email contact with Sheri everything went smooth.  She was very accommodating as well to a couple of requests I had.  The bike was waiting for us when we arrived and after filling out some paperwork we were on our way.  We had a mishap with the bike and EagleRider made every effort to have us back up and running by the next morning.  We appreciated their efforts and concern.  Sheri was more than fair with us in dealing with the situation when we came back.  The people were friendly.  We had a great time touring Southern California.  Thanks again EagleRider.  See you next year wherever we end up.</Text>

I rented a Slingshot from them after they made me wait one week because they can do not how to communicate with their customers , then they cancelled my reservation on the day after i was suppose to rent the Slingshot. When i finally did get to rent it it was the worst experince , it was filthy and super rundown and i mean disgusting. So please save your $330 dollars and rent something else< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) As part of our self-planned tour of the Western United States, we quickly decided to rent a Harley on August 3rd, 2014 at EagleRider. Unlike the hustle and bustle of Eagle Rider in Los Angeles and the long wait for pickup due to heavy traffic, I can only recommend EagleRider San Diego as an absolute insider tip. Nice welcome, very personal and friendly, our booked Harley Street Glide was unavailable due to a previous total loss. We were offered 2 similar machines, we chose an Indian Chieftain, and it was a good decision. New machine, top condition, easy handling. The return was completely relaxed. Super. We will be back.

Im Gegensatz zur bei Eagle Rider in Los Angeles herrschenden Hektik und langen Wartezeit bei der Abholung aufgrund großen Andrangs kann ich EagleRider San Diego nur als absoluten Geheimtip empfehlen. Netter Empfang, sehr persönlich und freundlich, unsere gebuchte Harley Street Glide war aufgrund eines vorangegangenen Totalschadens nicht verfügbar. Uns wurden 2 vergleichbare Maschinen angeboten, wir haben uns für eine Indian Chieftain entschieden, und es war eine gute Entscheidung. Neue Maschine, Top Zustand, problemlose Abwicklung. Auch die Rückgabe lief völlig entspannt ab. Super. Wir kommen gerne wieder.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

At 1:45 on a Sunday your line was more than halfway down your store with only one cashier.  I have picture proof.  Then with 20 people in line she went to help someone with balloons.  This is ridiculous horrible!!< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) This place has what is generally needed at home at very good prices. The store is in a safe establishment and the schedules are very convenient. The staff is friendly, but most of the times I've come there are only one or two ATMs available so it makes the lines very long. It only receives three stars because the maintenance of the store is not very good. There are scraps and wrappers on the floor of the entire store.

(Original)
Este lugar tiene lo general que se necesita en casa a muy buenos precios. La tienda está en un establecimiento seguro y los horarios son muy convenientes. El personal es amable, pero la mayoría de veces que he venido solamente hay uno o dos cajeros disponible así que hace las filas muy largas. Solamente recibe tres estrellas porque el mantenimiento de la tienda no es muy bueno. Hay deshechos y envoltorios  en el suelo de toda la tienda.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
We've been coming to this place a few times a month prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now during the pandemic, this is one of the few places we come to when we're tired of cooking at home. Thank goodness that they're still open for to-go orders. Just place your order on the phone and your food will be ready for pick-up in about 15 - 20 mins. Their setup is really easy to maintain social distancing especially with contact-less payment. Their food is consistently good with decent sized portions. Their #20 Yang Chow Fried Rice and #15 Curry are our favorite items. On cold days, their #1 House Bowl and #5 Assorted Seafood noodle soups are great choices.</Review>

Second time here...even better!Yummy-doodle noodles...thick or thin? Great broth base to every meal. Really tasty food. ☆☆☆☆☆ Exceptional care=your enjoyment.
Everything made to your order and if you don't like it...they really take it back right away and change it. That is "proper restaurant ediquite."
I had a scrumptious bowl of seafood soup. My mouth is watering writing about it now.
The portions feed you twice...and they reheat beautifully...in the best take-away cups money can buy. They are about giving their customer the very best. Bravo! Refreshing!
Prices are very reasonable...especially if you half it for two meals.
In the Diamond Bar area...a diffident "check-it-out-top-spot" on my list!
P.S.
Best Tai tea I ever had...on any Continent!</Review>

<review>I love the Thai eggplant with chicken + Hainan rice. It's so tasty.
The Hainan chicken here is with bone. It tastes good but not for my lazy kids who don't eat anything with bone.<//review>< Resp>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Ordered through grubhub and went to pick it up. Quick service and generous portions. Saw that it was a Chinese Asian fusion local restaurant that we’ve been meaning to try. All items had clean flavors. Nicely priced
Pad see ew - tasted like a noodle dish, tasted more Chinese than Thai.
Popcorn chicken - tastes homemade. Different from what you’d get at tea/boba spots.
House noodle soup - clean broth flavor. Had shrimp, pork, beef and fish balls inside< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
Popcorn chicken was super dry. Fried rice was bland. French style filet mignon with rice was decent. The meat was tender and juicy. The soup noodle was so so (and I think they forgot to include the bean sprout in my togo order). My wife didn't like any of the dishes that I ordered, so we will not be back in the future. Sorry, I really would love to see mom and pop establishment to flourish, but the food just isn't on par...<//Review>

By far the best place to get your Ramen and Pho fixes. Their cold noodles are so tasty and very interesting to make. My favorite is their pork ramen, sooooo yummy. I do wish their egg was a little softer but still delicious! The owners are incredibly nice! I love this place.<//Text>

<Review>Use to come here and it was good but today they served me some freaken Dogg food. I had send back the lamb skewers they looked nasty and cold. Ordered the duck noodle bowl and they give me bones in every bite of the duck meet. Nasty.  And all I hear in the back is sneezing and coughing. Even throat Hocking. I think this had to do my race lot of Oriental  people but when a brown man comes in, the customers and staff gock at you. Someone called the health department. I got food poisoning in only within two hours of eating this slop!!! what happened to his place. Still have mad respect for Oriental noodle shops but this place can get shut down.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

When my food was don't they put it in a togo container and I sat down. It was really spicy and I'm one of those people who can't enjoy there food if it's to spicy. I didn't know it was going to be like that. I asked them if they can make it less spicy and she argued with me. A no would of been just fine. I'm guessing her husband came out and was very nice and more then willing to make it less spicy. It taste exactly the same.. lol I'm hungry and don't feel like putting up with it. Not coming back unfortunately.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>I went in for the first time in Saturday to get my haircut. I set appointment for 1pm and was in my chair at 1pm did not have to wait. Erwin cut my hair and no one has ever cut my hair as good as this guy. He was quick, careful and the fade was on point. Great people person and pretty much can trust him to get the job done. I will definitely be going back in a couple weeks and plan on this being my spot now. Thanks brotha 👊🏻< /Text>< pictures>

I came to these google reviews looking for positive feedback from customers before going. After receiving my cut, I can say this shop is a hard pass. Dude was on the phone most of the time while cutting me. Environment was cool and friendly but I wouldn't recommend it for a solid cut. Overpriced too for the lackluster cut.</text>

<time>1603823854787<//time><rating>3</rating><Text>So, first off I’ll say I do appreciate the small business vibe here and the guys do a great job with the cuts, which is why I’ve consistently returned. My big issue is pricing inconsistencies ... I’ve been going to this barbershop since moving from NYC in June (So I’ve had roughly 4 haircuts) each of those times I’ve not paid the same price for a single cut. Someone explain to me how that makes sense? Today, after getting a haircut and a simple buzz of my beard ( no razor, no trimmer, as my skin is super sensitive) I was charged $40!! My first trip there, I paid $27, my second trip I paid $28, my third trip I paid $37... now this trip $40?!?!

When I asked the guy he looked at me in bewilderment. Sadly because of this, I won’t be returning.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1603825806796, 'text': 'Haircut is 28 any there services added to that is extra charge, thank you'}</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I really appreciated how they ran the walk in line, First Come, First Serve. They really don't show any favoritism, even a well known Regular had to wait his turn.
I got the haircut I described, but not the one i had in mind. Regardless, it was a great a cut, and definitely what i described. With that in mind, make sure you are clear on what you want, if you can find a picture even better.

These guys know what they are doing, are polite, professional, friendly and take great pride in their work.

I highly recommend these guys any day.</Text>< gmapID>

I’m from nyc, and I’ve tried to find a barber that can cut hair to the caliber of east coast barbers, been through over 20 barbers out here, and I finally found this place. Best barbers in Los Angeles.<//Review>

<Review>DO NOT GO HERE No matter what you say High fade, low fade, mid fade. They will still give you a high fade and are very unapologetic about it if you address it with them.

Yes I do work on appointments only sorry and like I said if I said that to a client is because we get along. Fat I am y cuz it’s the good life now you can take your anger at life somewhere else.

A shop with "fade" in the name should at least know the difference between a high fade and a low fade.  A low fade is not anything at all like a flat top jarhead military cut.  And what certified barber uses a straight razor without any cream or hot towel at all?  I'd rather pay a little more and actually get the haircut I want instead of just everybody gets the same cut no matter what.

Edit: It took these nerds 3 years to respond to this review and they tried to throw shade instead of dealing with said incompetence.  Tells you a lot about this place and the people running it.</review>

Got a decent cut from here, but the air conditioner was broken and the service wasn't too friendly.< /review>

Wonderful people and service. Had an accident and my insurance company called them and requested for them to tow my car which was 50 miles from their shop. When I brought my keys to them after work the lady in the front office was wonderful, helped make me feel comfortable and less stressed. Can't wait for my car to be complete. I know it will be in much better shape. Live by its name.. Will recommend.<//review>

I took my pickup to Integrity for a repair. The woman who handled my case was superb. She kept me well informed on progress, and was exceptional at working with my insurance company. When I arrived to pick up my truck, I was happy. My truck was as good as new, and the owner took time to walk me through the details of the repair, and made sure I was satisfied before we did the paperwork. I highly recommend Integrity Auto Collision Center.<//text>

<text>I dealt with Maggie and Mario and they were awesome.  This was not an insurance covered repair so I could have used anyone,  but they came highly recommended and they didn't disappoint.  They were professional,  communicated throughout the entire process and the finished work was exceptional.  They even discovered that a bolt to one of the suspension arms was missing and ordered the part and gave it to me  when I picked it up. They aren't mechanics but they did this on their own just make sure I could drive it safely. Above and beyond!

Use them,  you won't be disappointed.

A big thank you to Maggie,  Mario and the rest of the Integrity team.</text>< pics>

Fantastic work!!! I had some minor damage on my front bummer and they fixed my car right up so it looked better than new.  They kept me updated during the repair process and finished the work exactly when they said they would. Outstanding customer service!! Highly recommend this car shop for any repairs!< /Text>

<Text>Nobody wants to have to deal with the hassle of getting your car repaired after an automobile accident, that's a known fact-That was until I stepped foot into Integrity Auto Collision. From beginning to end Oscar and his team made the experience seamlessly pleasant and surprisingly enjoyable! From their professional and knowledgeable expertise of dealing with automobile insurance companies to the techs superior work on the repairs. I couldn't be happier, nor satisfied...

(Back story) I was side swiped in a parking lot, while shopping. Upon returning to my car, a lovely love note was awaiting me to inform me, my car had been hit. (This is the type of note, no one ever likes to receive however, I'm thankful the other driver left their info) I knew about Integrity by my boyfriend, whom was also hit while parked. He sent me their link and off I was to get an estimate. I was greeted by Maggie and Oscar whom are incredibly personable and professional. The lobby to the shop is clean and inviting.  I knew this was going to be a match for getting the repairs done to my car. Oscar did an estimate, I reached out to inform the other drivers insurance that I had a preferred shop..dropped my car off, was provided a rental car FROM Integrity! (Which made it so much easier!) A week later and communication texts every step of the way, I'm back on the road with my personal car.

Honestly,  if you're in need of body repairs I HIGHLY recommend this shop. The staff is top notch and you won't be disappointed.<//Text>< user_id>

I have used Integrity for several auto body repairs and every time has been a positive experience. Oscar, my service coordinator, was more than helpful. He made sure my son’s brand new car was repaired to perfection. Great service and communication. Felt like I was in very good hands and he worked everything out with insurance. Thanks Oscar and the Integrity Team!</review>

<text>Maggie was amazing to work with! She is extremely patient, kind and understanding of your situation. She is thorough, responsive to the customer's needs and wishes, and won't allow any third party to interrupt or declare a change in service without ensuring the customer's wishes are being met. My situation was difficult, to say the least, but their service was as professional as possible. As for the body work that they completed on my beloved vehicle, it looks truly amazing and like brand new! I recommend Integrity for anyone in need of an auto body repair!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Unfortunately my new car was involved in a hit & run accident and the dealership where I purchased the car recommended Integrity Collision Repair. They were friendly, courteous, always kept me informed of the process, timely and supportive during a horrible time for me. The team here really lives up to their name!! They were willing to fight with me, when I was having an issue with my insurance company. The team at Integrity were very professional but made me feel like family. Although my vehicle was deemed unrepairable, the Integrity Team, help me get through the process and now I’m looking for a new car. They made sure I knew my rights as a consumer, because they worked for you, the vehicle owner and not the insurance company!!! I hope I never need their services again (don’t want another accident) but if I do, I know where I’m going. Integrity Auto Collision Repair you guys get an A+ with honors.< /Text>

<Review>This place is AWESOME! Words can't express how great it was working with Oscar Moreno at Integrity Auto Collision. Everything was explained to me in detail as what they were doing, and what to expect. He helped with understanding the insurance process as well as the law. My car was totaled and I had no idea what to do next. Oscar made it so much easier....I'll never go anywhere else and will tell everyone who will listen to go to Integrity Auto Collision in Fairfield!<//Review><response>None</response><name>Lisa Schow< /name><user>105982460808872609409<//user><date>1612635579824<//date>< pics>

<text>Integrity Auto has hands down the best customer service! I came to have some paint damage repaired and They kept me in the loop the whole process of getting things repaired. When my car was finished they helped me connect with the other drivers insurance to process the payment so that I could take my car home right away! In addition to the excellent customer service they do beautiful work and made my bumper look brand new!</text>< Rating>

After my vehicle was in a minor accident they assisted in evaluating the car and communicated well and in a timely manner with the insurance company. They also maintained constant communication with me which was reassuring. They maintained themselves neutral throughout the entire process but also assisted me with any questions or concerns that I had. I hope to never be involved in an accident again but if I ever find myself needing an auto body shop, this is the place to go!</Text>

<review>This was my first time taking my car to Integrity Auto Collision Center. They're an excellent team. Oscar kept me in the loop of all communication between him and my insurance which I greatly appreciated.  He sent me pictures of different stages of my car. When I picked up my car it was immaculate. The paint job was flawless. Everything looked as new. Can I just add Oscar knows his laws when it comes to making sure the insurance pays for everything.  My insurance was being difficult not wanting to pay for a few things. Oscar was able to prove to the insurance by law and why these things needed to be done. I appreciate your honesty and commitment to this place. Thank you Integrity Auto Collision Center. I will definitely bring my car to you guys next time it's needed.</review>< Pictures>

Working with this particular auto body shop was the best decision I made. The staff is very professional and fast but most importantly they very much value any customer. So much respect, concern and passion they put into their taking care of their customer, vehicle and situation. Jennifer, shes the best! Throughout the entire time she was fast to communicate any information with me. Explains everything clearly & efficiently. Jennifer has compassion and shows maximum effort to ensure that customers are happy in the end. Best auto body shop and Staff. 100/10 recommended.</Review>

<Review>From the moment you walk in this place, you sense the professionalism of this business.  Drinks, coffee, and snacks while you wait.  Super clean.  Peek over at their work area and everything is super clean and organized.  They communicate along the process.  They walk you through the estimate.  Second time I use this business and only business I will use going forward.  They did a fantastic job on both cars I’ve taken.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<review>Brought in my 2020 Honda Accord with damage to my bumper. Jennifer Franco kept me in loop from the beginning, from tear down to insurance responses to vehicle pick up. She does not play around. Great customer service! I don’t think I can trust any other body shop with my car. Definitely will be recommending to EVERYONE I know.</review></record>

If I can give this company more than five stars I would. Jennifer and everybody there were truly exceptional as far as their customer service and the detail of their work. I am beyond pleased in how my car looks so much better than before my accident. If you want the job done right and you love your car bring it to Integrity they aim to please and you can tell by the reviews that they live up to that quality of service. Thank you once again< /review>

Integrity Auto compares to non other in the Fairfield area! Took my truck in after an accident damaging the front passenger fender, headlamp and front bumper. They got it done ahead of schedule and even worked it out to replace the driver side headlamp as well at no extra charge! All parts used were OEM even though insurance authorized aftermarket. Paint job was amazing! No orange peel and on a black truck that’s not easy. Blend work was perfect. I highly recommend them for any body work and paint even if your insurance does not contract with them. They offer their own lifetime warranty so it doesn’t matter anyways. Very professional and attention to detail in their work. Highly recommended!< /text>

Very professional, courteous, top notch! Jennifer and her team took care of my Genesis G90 which needed the bumper and scratch marks repainted. They were able to do this while preserving the integrity of the tech and safety features. Very impressed. Definitely worth getting it done right the first time.

Once I committed to using Integrity and dropped  off my vehicle they’ve been in constant contact informing me about the process and any communication between them and my insurance company. They have definitely gone above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. Now that my vehicle has been returned I can see all the quality work that was done and I’m so appreciative.

< Review>
Just picked up our car yesterday and overall we had a great experience. They dealt with the insurance company directly in regards to the necessary repairs and cost. We were given updates via text on estimates, status, and they worked with us on drop off and pick ups times. There was no long wait time. I liked that they have business relationship with Enterprise Rental Car. We got picked up to get our rental car from Integrity and we were able to just drop off the rental car at Integrity when our car was ready for pick up. Overall, it was a easy process, especially when the damage to our car was not our fault. Thanks Jennifer for your great service!< /Review>

Very good service. This was the second shop I went to after not feeling comfortable with the estimate and insurance process at the first shop and what a difference. They were very thorough, and kept me informed of the process. The cherry on top was picking up my car and noticing they pretty much detailed and clean the entire car almost back to brand new when I purchased it 6 months ago. Not that I want to get in more accidents, but if we do, we are coming to Integrity. Thank you Jennifer and staff.<//Text>

<Review>This is the best auto collision repair shop hands down! The customer service is amazing! Maggie goes above and beyond for her customers- I should know, I've been here on 3 different occasions for 3 different accidents that happened throughout the year (2019). And each time Maggie took very good care of me! Maggie inspected the damages with me right next to her, and she explained their process and what would be done to repair the vehicle; she is very thorough and detailed compared to other body shops I've been to.

Also, the shop is meticulously clean and everyone is warm and friendly. I appreciate the fact that they use genuine parts, and not aftermarket parts, like other body shops use. The repairs done to my vehicle were pristine, and the exterior of my car looked brand new! Shiny, glossy and all! I highly recommend this auto repair shop.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1581536860869, 'text': "Thanks for trusting the team, we're very happy that we've served you properly in all threw times. -Team Integrity"}<//Response>< pics>

Excellent repairs and beautiful paint. This shop is the best!  Thanks for advocating for us and working so tirelessly with our insurance company.  Would not want to take our cars anywhere else.</Review>

Upon my first encounter with them, I already knew this would be the shop to repair my vehicle based on their professional and respectful approach to the consumer. Oscar was my advisor from the very start and he had detailed every little step in the repair process. He had advised me that they strictly follow factory repair guidelines using factory parts. He had even explained the responsibilities of the at fault party's insurance to ensure I was being provided the appropriate services I was entitled to. His passion to be a consumer advocate helped solidify my decision to leave my vehicle under their care. Upon leaving my vehicle, they took the initiative to arrange a rental vehicle for myself. Throughout the entire repair process, they maintained constant communication via text with pictures of the repairs. This gave me the reassurance I needed that my vehicle was under the hands of professionals. I was surprised most when they had called to tell me my vehicle was finished and ready for pick up a week earlier compared to the estimated completion date. When I went to pick up my vehicle and examine the repair, it showed their speed did not sacrifice quality. My vehicle appeared in the same condition as when it was first purchased from the dealership. In the end, I am extremely grateful they were able to restore my vehicle back to immaculate condition. Their pride in workmanship definitely showed in their quality!<//Review>< Rating>

<review>What a great group of people! I side swiped a short concrete wall with a brand new truck and damaged the rocker panel and door. You can’t even tell any work was done to the truck! No weld seems are even visible. They even got the work done quickly so I could take it on our trip. I can’t recommend them enough. I have total trust an confidence in them!  *HIGHLY RECOMMEND* them!!< /review>< pictures>

People there are also very nice and helpful; they will ask your opinion on choosing the repair parts; update the repair progress daily; also, they help you with car rental and return. Most important, they have the skills and spirits to make your car as before, even better!</Review>< pics>

Oscar did a phenomenal job throughout the repair of my G70.   From discussing how insurance would be worked with, to messaging me daily with progress updates, he always made sure I had no questions about the entire process.  No surprises, just top not service, and my car looked as good as new when completed!  Two thumbs up!</Text>

Maggie and the staff at Integrity Auto Collision Center are fantastic! I was in a bad situation with my insurance company since November 4th 2019; which Integrity helped me out of. My insurance company was dragging their feet to settle a claim In that my insurance company was trying to piece meal a major repair without any concern of quality, with picking and choosing what “they” deemed as to what was needed for the repair ( to my new 2019 Tundra.... with a bent frame ); not what Integrity seen as to what was needed for a correct and proper repair. Integrity lives up to their motto: “We Work For You!”... I just feel sorry for what they had to put up with from my insurance company. Thanks again Integrity for your professional service delivered with a lot of personality and concern helping out in the settlement.<//Review>

Integrity embodies the word. They are very helpful to my situation with my insurance company. Integrity gave me advice on what to do next and went out of their way to suggest that my car is a total loss instead of them fixing it letting my car depreciate in the long run. Thanks Integrity and more power.< /review>

My car was hit while parked, and Integrity took this poor situation and brought me out in the best way possible. This was the first time I’ve had a car get hit, and Jennifer helped me understand the process.

They are a third party shop, which means they don’t have contracts and thus incentives from insurance companies to cut corners. She worked with the insurance company to make sure I got the work I needed. For example, they wanted to use after market parts, and she was able to make sure I received those from the manufacturer.

I’d recommend going to them before you go to whatever shop the insurance company tries to send you to. You may still need to get a second quote to appease the insurance or you may be able to skip the second step depending on the insurance rep.

Integrity took the headache out of the process, made it seamless, were friendly, professional and efficient.

Finally, my car came out looking way better than it did before the accident. I’ll be recommending them to all my friends and family.< /Text>

Took my 2014 Accord into Integrity for work to be done after a good sized deer jumped off a hillside onto my car. Bottom line; don’t waste your time looking for a body shop. Just go to Integrity. They more than lived up to their name. The work they did is flawless, and the people I worked with, Oscar and (mainly) Jennifer, couldn’t have been nicer. They we’re informative and very professional. I was kept up to speed during the entire process. My main desire was to get my car back to its original Honda glory, which they did, having such great people to work with was icing on the cake.  Thank you Integrity Auto Collision Center!<//review>

We gave you a tour of our shop, and we explained our process which you really liked. We helped you by providing the insurance with the proper photos and our original estimate.\n\nUnfortunately the insurance company policy did not cover for original parts or our labor rates. We offered to help you for the differences on the after market parts to original parts, we also negotiated the time to perform the pre and post scans and cut our time in half in order to help you financially ($95 off).\n\nWe found it fair that if we helped you with $95,  you or the person who hit you would have been able to come out of pocket with $30 dollars.\n\nWe did not wrecked your vehicle, nor we are the insurance. We\'re providing a service, and we have an established labor rate. If the insurance does not want to pay fairly, why do we have to lose money on that repair? How is it fair for us when we\'re not at fault? we\'re just providing a service, and we take pride in what we do.\n\nAll businesses are different and we all have different labor rates. Do you pay the same for Macy\'s as you do in Walmart? No.\n\nAs for your Yelp insinuations, that\'s completely false. All of our reviews are legitimate, and they do not require for our clientele to be here to post them nor we give them a "reward". That goes against our integrity and Yelp trustworthy policies.\n\nBest regards,\n\nThe Integrity family.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x8085141569c29f3d:0x9d02d1e9587ba34c</Gmap_id><rating>2<//rating>< Time>

<Review>Integrity maybe has integrity but at your own expense. Let me elaborate:
Integrity are not flexible, means, if insurance asked them to lower their hourly rate a little bit or lower their price to be in-line with other body shops, they will not. That means, you will be responsible for any extra Dollar amount  not approved by the insurance, which also include any damages have not been discovered yet.
It happens to me. Their hourly rate is $95; the insurance asked them to change it to $90; they refused. So for $30, they lost my business.
Who wants to pay money for damage done by another person to his/her own car. Is it enough trouble the person is going through ????
If you use Integrity, be ready to contribute extra $$$ to fix your car, since insurance companies 100% of the times will not pay any body shop what they asked for.
Also, most body shops deal directly with the insurance company, but not Integrity when it comes to estimate negotiation. They will ask you to talk to your insurance in order to accept their estimate or pay the difference from your pocket. Very time consuming and never expected a body shop to ask you to do that.
Their is a reviewer gave them 1 star, and yes it's true; they have Yelp advertisement to give you a reward if you do Yelp review and give them 5 stars at their location before you leave.
Yelp reviews were misleading to me, since all reviews have to be done on their location.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

While I was not happy to be dealing with my first Auto collision, Integrity Auto made it a quick and painless experience. After clearly explaining the damages to my vehicle, I dropped off my car and they arranged a rental car for me to use in the meantime. They sent me regular updates on my car which I really appreciated. It looks like the damage never happened and they even touched up my paint a little bit at no additional cost. My car looks great and I am happy with the job they did! I would recommend them to anyone in the Fairfield area.<//Review>

Thank you for the repair of my 2017 Ford King Ranch, the work was top notch custom quality.  I’m glad I brought it to integrity, I will surely tell everyone who is looking for a reputable paint shop to call “Integrity Auto Collision Center” this shop surely lives up to their name.

Thank you Oscar & Team 👍🏽<//Text>

I was recommended to go to Integrity after a small rear end accident on May 3rd. I went straight there just to see what kind of estimate I could get on my car. As soon as I arrived, I was greeted with great customer service. The workers at the front desk gave nothing less than their utmost concern for what my car is worth, and they informed me of every right I have as the individual not at fault in the accident.

From there the process was very smooth, Integrity's staff kept good contact with me informing me of anything happening with my car. There was never any miscommunication or hold up. Any time there was a chance to possibly get something better for my car, they were able to find parts completely worth the car's original value, if not more.

Last, I could not have asked for faster or more efficient service. It took less than a month (22 days) for my car to be fixed and better than it was before. The accident was not major, but the honest estimate gave me a look into how there was more damage inside the car. I give Integrity 5 stars because of their honesty and the amazing service that was completely worth those 22 days. Thanks Integrity!!!!!!< /text>

They were  helpful in keeping us on budget. No one likes to deal with the insurance company, but they walked us through questions to ask and what to look for when dealing with the adjuster.  So it was nice to have someone that was more interested in keeping the customer satisfied. Friendly staff and Oscar  walked us through every step of what work had to be done and helped us decide if something had to be done to be safe, or just look good. Highly recommend this place.</Text>

I had previously been referred to this shop by a friend, and now it’s the only place I’ll take my car! They’re worth the drive to me because I know when I hand over the keys, they’ll take care of my car as if it’s their own. I’ve now had to bring in my car on three separate occasions and each time I’ve been more and more impressed. Friends that have seen the past damage have all complimented how my car looks brand new and like nothing ever happened. I’ve worked with Jenny, Lisa, and the owner/manager, Oscar, has checked in with me each visit and takes the time to walk me out to my car and show me the work that’s been done to ensure I’m happy with the end product. I mean it just can’t get any better when you receive personalized service from every person you interact with.</Review>

Great team at Integrity Auto Collision Center.  I found them through online reviews, dropped by for a quote and ended up using them for a simple repair to the hood.  The car belonged to my aunt, who ended up in a hospice situation.  When we went to collect it, we found some hood damage ... even though the car just sat in her carport for almost a year with no one driving it.  Jennifer from Integrity was my first contact through email and helped me through the estimate process.  She also kept me informed of status through regular email updates.  The entire team was very patient through the lengthy insurance issue that arose from the fact that my aunt had apparently already claimed the accident, unbeknownst to me.  So, with a lot of back and forth, the insurance ended up paying for partial repairs and we paid for the rest.  The simple repair turned into a month-long ordeal of back and forth, but Jennifer kept on top of it and kept me in the loop.  On pickup day, Oscar helped me fill out the final paperwork and I was out the door quickly.  The repair looks great and they even detailed the inside of the car, which looks better than it has in a long time.  I would fully endorse using Integrity Auto Collision Center for your repair needs and would definitely bring my Lexus or other vehicles to them.<//text>

Integrity auto collision went above and beyond for us.  They made sure that we got high grade  quality parts for our car and they were done in  a timely  manner.   There costumer service was great and worked well with my insurance even  when my insurance wanted them to one thing they did what was best for our car.

<Text>I just picked up my car from Integrity and couldn't be happier.  All I needed was to have my rear bumper replaced, but I had to go through my insurance.  Integrity helped me with, and took care of everything along the way.

The facility is clean, and modern. The staff are courteous, and professional.  If you need body work in the Fairfield area this is THE shop to use!<//Text>< resp>

Great service! Kept me updated the whole time my car was in the shop. I came here from another body shop that did a horrible job with my car. Maggie was super nice and helped me out so much with what was really going on with my car and everything the other body shop did WRONG! Educated me with everything i needed to know about my car unlike most bodyshops. They pay big attention to detail! Never going anywhere else! Highly recommend to anyone trying to get their car fixed the RIGHT WAY!</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Surprise, surprise! I was rear ended on the freeway on the same side of my bumper as my previous fender bender!!! What are the chances!? Since I had just been in a minor accident last august I knew exactly what to do this time around.

Since this is my second accident in a short period of time, I've learned that insurance companies have contracts with certain body shops. Consider going to a shop that works for YOU and your best interest and not the insurance companies' best interest!!  I highly suggest you choose Integrity! They will get the job done right and return your car looking amazing!

Their customer service is beyond satisfactory and their waiting area is very nicely decorated! My car looked amazing when I received it back! They vacuumed it and cleaned it up extremely well! Amazing work.</Review>< pics>

My first time being involved in a collision and Oscar, Maggie, and Lisa made the whole repair process easy and smooth. They explained how everything worked from the insurance claims to the repairs, giving me peace of mind. The staff are professional and the facility is super clean and welcoming. Thank you Oscar and team!</Text>

Picked up my car from integrity today and it is perfect.  I was working with a different insurance company since I was rear-ended and it was not going great until I found integrity.  They knew just what to do and really fought hard for me to make sure my car was fixed properly.  I will never go anywhere else after this experience.</Text>

We took our 2004 Yukon to Integrity Auto Collision after being involved in an accident. The staff is super friendly,  and their location is clean and well organized. The staff made sure my car had the best quality parts, and work done. When we received our car back it looked better than when we first bought it. Great place and staff will recommend for everyone. Thanks Integrity for the great work.</review>

Here at Integrity Auto Collision Center they are truly a testament to their name, they have the upmost integrity with the quality of work that they do and they truly care for their customers. You can trust that the work done on your vehicle will be high quality. I have taken my car to them multiple times and I have been 100% satisfied every time. I also want to thank my local Progressive representative David Benson. Sometimes going through your insurance provider can be a challenge but David went above and beyond to make sure that I was taken care of. If you are in the Fairfield area I would highly recommend you going to Integrity Auto Collision Center and if you are with Progressive Insurance ask for David Benson.</text>

Took my wife Infiniti EX37 Journey to have it repaired after a Hit and Run Accident. Meet Greg as my estimator he was very knowledgeable and courteous. I did not hesitate to have Integrity Auto Body do the job. They went above and beyond the scoop of the work that was paid for by my Insurance. Me and my wife were very pleased with the outcome of her vehicle. I would highly recommend Integrity to everyone. They will exceed in making your vehicle like new again . My hats off to Greg for everything he did to provide great customer service.<//text>

<text>I got rear ended in a parking lot a few weeks ago. I stopped by to check them out, since they had such high yelp reviews. I am new to the area, and didn't know of any businesses worth trusting. These guys were great. They helped me process the insurance claim, since I had no idea what to do, they gave me a ride to the rental car, and they called me every few days to give me updates on my car. Oscar and Fidel were completely amazing! They even detailed my car while it was in the shop.

The payment process was completely transparent. I understood exactly what they had done for me, they went above and beyond and made sure to replace all the parts necessary with new parts, not salvage parts, and I feel comfortable coming to them if I have any questions. They also took tons of pictures of the repairs process for me to keep for my insurance records. I felt like they really cared about my business, and were eager to help me. I will be coming to them again if I need any help.</text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I was in my first terrible car accident on 7/5/18. Oscar and his wonderful employees walked me through the steps to get my car fix. After the break down, Oscar called me in to tell me my car can’t be fixed and it would need to be totaled. I really appreciated how he showed me the internal damage. My unibody was bent and buckled in numerous places. My not so good neighbor insurance company said no it could be fixed. Oscar and his employees fought for me so hard. Oscar and I would have 3-way calls with the insurance company and it wouldn’t help. After almost a month fighting with the insurance company, Oscar finally got them to total it on 7/31/18.

Oscar and his crew are very helpful and they will keep you in a constant lope on what’s happening with your car. They will also go to bat for you to make sure the insurance companies are making you whole. I would highly recommend everyone to take there car to Integrity. You will not be disappointed.

Oscar and the crew.....THANK YOU for all the help you all did for me at the stressful time. I really appreciate it. You have a customer for life.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Integrity Auto Collision - Family own and operated with a focus on excellence and community.

This is probably the second review I’ve ever written.  It might even be the first, sense I can’t remember actually writing one before this one.  I value reviews a lot, and for me, online reviews are among the most valuable aspects of social media, and my contribution is way over due.

I recently needed bodywork to be done on my Porsche Cayman.  I’m fairly new to the area so I headed straight to Yelp to try to find the best team to handle to job.  The reviews where very positive so I went in to test to get a closer look for the TLC I wanted my car to have.

First Take:
Oscar knows his stuff. The facility is as pristine as an auto body shop can be.  Every person on the staff is very professional in their interaction and service with the customer. By the time I left I felt more knowledge  about the full process of what a proper collision center should offer in expertise, products and service. My decision was made.

Second Take:
Less than a week later I dropped my car off and left town a trip.  I felt very confident that Integrity Auto Collision would make my car repair a top priority, and have it completed promptly.  Oscar and Amy at  AAA were AMAZING; being communicative at every point along that way.  They included me on every email so there were no loose strings or communication breakdowns. I didn’t think it could be so seamless. (I have heard horror stories from experiences other folks had with insurance companies.)  Oscar must have great relationships with insurance underwriters (or at least with AAA).

Third Take:
The finished product is superb. My car looked so gorgeous! It's a ’09 and I’ve had a few people wonder if it was a 2018. Haha!  Some of my biker friends are thinking of getting their Harley painted after seeing the care and detain that was given to my baby.  I will have any work need completed at Integrity Auto Collision.  Big Up to the entire team at Integrity Auto and AAA Auto insurance.  I hope to drive more business your way.

Very best regards,

Integrity auto body is by far the Best auto body that I've ever been to.  Fidel was able to describe in detail, the type of work that was going to be done, and it only took a few days for them to get my new front bumper painted and install it.  My car was washed and ready to go when I picked it up.  The Paint Job is flawless! They word is backed up by their work.  Thank you for being able to take care of my car in such a timely manner.  GOD Bless You all.

Respectfully

My insurance was recommending me to go to one of their network shops, then I found out that they won't really cater for the customer's benefit. I started looking for a place that would make me feel like home and found Integrity. Great customer service, staff is knowledgeable and well experienced. They repaired by 2016 RAM in no time. Thanks!< /Review>

<text>Update: 5/1/2020
New Review

This is the second time I have done business with Integrity Auto Collision. The second go around I actually needed body work done to my car. I would like to send a big thank you to Jennifer, Oscar, and the team at Integrity Auto for the amazing dedication for taking care of my family and flawless work they did on my car.

During this ongoing pandemic the last thing you want to worry about is traveling and possibly exposing yourself to the virus. Oscar and Jennifer took that stress away by offering to pick up the car from my home and drive it to their shop. Once they picked up the car Jennifer consistently communicated with me to let me know the progress on the car and other ways they could save me money.

Little did I know that insurance companies don’t have to replace your car parts with original manufacture parts. They can be after market or from the junk yard. Jennifer was able to work her magic and get the numbers down to a great price I could pay. That right there sweetened the deal for me. Like I’ve said in my previous review. Not only do you get excellent customer service with Integrity Auto Collision. You also get a no BS attitude from them and they will try their best to help YOU out. Not the insurance company, but YOU the consumer.

In summary I would keep coming back to them if I ever need work done in the future and would recommend others to do the same. Don’t take my word for it. Talk to Oscar or Jennifer and see for yourself.

My wife had gotten into a car accident in early December of last year. We had looked around for a body shop to get quotes on repairs and we stumbled upon Integrity Auto Collision through Yelp. We saw all the great reviews and we decided to take our car there. Once I arrived at the shop and met the staff and the owner Oscar, I was pleasantly surprised by the honest and informative information I was given pertaining to my vehicle.

The conversations that I had with Oscar were something that I was not expecting at all from a body shop. Usually you get the run around and kind of left in the dark when it comes to dealing with an insurance company and the body shop. But in our case in dealing with Integrity Auto Collision, the experience was superb. The owner, Oscar and I had many great conversations regarding how to handle my claim and how the process works between consumer and insurance company. He makes it a point to inform you about your rights and how to handle your claim with your insurance company. He broke down financial numbers with me and different scenarios regarding our situation and what would be most beneficial financially for us if we decided to keep our car or have it taken by the insurance company.

Let me tell you I have never dealt with a company like this before. The staff and owner seem genuinely interested and vested in trying to make sure the consumer can leave their shop satisfied with an outcome that benefits the consumer. It truly was a breathe of fresh air to see the level of customer service and commitment to helping others that I saw from this shop. I would definitely recommend Integrity Auto Collision to my friends and family and bring my business back to them in the future!<//text><name>rainier diaz<//name>< userid>

<Review>I am so glad that I decided to bring my truck ( 2004 Toyota Tundra white 4wd )to Integrity. When I walked in to the shop Oscar immediately took a look at my truck and went into detail on the work that will need to be done. He made sure that there will be no surprises. He took care of talking to my insurance company to make sure that all the needed repairs will be approved. Every Friday I would get a call from him giving me an update on the progress of the repair. The customer service was good but the quality of the work was even better. The body work on my truck is impressive. It looks brand new. The driving performance of the truck is also great. Thanks to Oscar and his awesome team - Juan 1.0, Luis, Sam, Victor, Ramon, Lester, Maggy, Greg, Lisa, Jenny, Juan 2.0 and Pablo. Dealing with a damaged vehicle is very stressful but you have taken away a lot of that stress.....Thank you much.....Emerson ;)</Review><gmapID>0x8085141569c29f3d:0x9d02d1e9587ba34c< /gmapID>< UserId.>

THE BEST AUTO COLLISION SHOP! I recommend Integrity Auto for their excellent customer service, honesty, professionalism, and overall great service from beginning to end.

My Prius Prime was rear-ended on a rainy day earlier this January. The rear bumper and rear right tail light needed replacement and quarter panel repaired. I was stressed out knowing I'll be going through the process of trying to get my car fixed and deal with insurance companies. I found Integrity Auto on yelp and read all their great reviews. Came in the same day and met Oscar who gave me the quote. He explained and educated me on everything regarding what parts are needed, costs, and the whole process.

Oscar really went above and beyond to make sure the insurance company paid for all the needed repairs to get the car back to its brand new shape. Dealing with insurance was no fun, since they were trying to give me a much lower estimate and they had slow response time with emails. He communicated with them and ensured they paid for every required part and service and really advocated for me. I received my car back and it looked brand new again and insurance paid for everything. They did such a great job on the repair. I got all OEM parts and the paint was blended so well to match the factory paint.

Oscar is extremely knowledgeable with the whole process, from the insurance end to the actual repair process. I learned quite a lot from talking to him. I'll for sure be coming back for any future needs.<//Text>

<Review>My experience was excellent. While I hated that my Mercedes was in an accident. I knew I made the right choice of choosing Integrity Auto Collision to return my car back to pre-accident condition.

I was informed by text daily of the progress of the repairs. Jennifer worked with Mercedes to get new OEM parts to repair my vehicle. They advocated for me when my insurance company’s adjuster wanted to take shortcuts to save her company money on the repairs.

While I hope I never need auto body repair again- I will recommend them to everyone who wants their vehicle repaired right and to pre accident condition.

Thank you Integrity for your awesome professional work !!!!!!!!</Review>< UserId.>

<Review>Integrity is a great place to take your card for repairs. I was in a small car accident in a parking lot & I knew that I was going to take my car there because I had heard nothing but great things from my sister and friend who'd both taken their cars there.

My car looks brand new and I have zero complaints about their service. I would describe them as efficient and organized and loved going into their offices which have nice AC and soda and coffee. Jenny, the tall girl is very helpful and great and Oscar is awesome! They both explain every part of the process very well.</Review><Name>Nataly Ramirez<//Name>< Time>

I brought my car here after being rear ended. I was treated very well by the entire staff, even though my insurance company made things needlessly difficult. My car looks great and they really fought for the repairs to be done with OEM, not used parts. They were also helpful with arranging pick up and drop off for my rental. Would bring my car here again... although i hope i don't have to!</review>

My car gets broken into at least once a year. I can say without exaggeration that Integrity instills a sense of confidence and comfort in knowing things are going to be okay. The process of working with Oscar and Maggie is so seamless and pleasant that I’m left with a part of me that wishes my car needed work more often. However the frequency of break-ins in this Lord of The Flies world we live in, I genuinely look forward to walking in to Integrity to see how the business has grown, as this business and the people here are gold. I’m sure I’ve said this to someone before, but I’ll say it again and for the record- If Fairfield was rated based on the merit of their small businesses, Integrity is one of the heavy hitters and is a savior in keeping Fairfield out of the realm of mediocrity. No matter where I live in the Bay Area, I’ll bring my car here for auto body work.<//Text>

This is now the 4th time I've brought my vehicles to them in the last 2 years...I guess you could say I've had some really bad luck

The only silver lining is these auto body magicians...its amazing how they can make my car look like it was never rear ended, side swiped,  or hit...they make it look good as new

What I like is that they really know what it takes to get your car just right & will go over everything with you in detail do you know exactly what needs to be done with your vehicle. They also don't cut corners & their work is amazing

I'm hoping it will be a very long time before I'm back there but I will continue to refer all my friends & family

Take it from me...being in a car accident is one of the most stressful things you can go through in life...these guys take care of it like it never happened

Thank you< /Text>

A top notch business in California. If I had a ding,dent or worse I would drive 500 miles and trust these guys. Went around town and got multiple quotes to replace trunk, Oscar and the guys did what I would consider the impossible. If you want professional quality, service and price; take your car here.<//Text>

<Review>Can't find the words to describe how grateful I feel with Oscar and the Integrity team. They go beyond a simple repair job, they do care about the customer and not only the money. When I was involved in an accident, the first thing I did was look for an independent shop; I've had awful experiences with the insurance preferred shops, because I know they always look out for the insurance company (as they do have a exclusivity contract). So finding Integrity was amazing, I couldn't be more happier. Thanks!!< /Review>< pics>

<user_name>Aaron Martinelli</user_name><Text>We had just moved to California from Texas and so we were are new to the area.  This was a problem because we didn't know anyone we could trust to repair my wife's car which I (my wife's version) accidentally closed the garage door on the hatch and did some damage.  So I began researching body shops and accidentally came across Integrity.  I set up an apt which was easy, meet with Fidel and we began talking and let me tell you he is a very interesting individual with a lot of knowledge and as I was getting my estimate he went into detail on what was going on and what they would do to fix it.  He presented me with the estimate and off I went thinking this is a honest guy.  We went on vacation, had some issues come up but I never forgot about the car and my wife didn't let me so about 1 month later I called and Fidel remembered me, how he did I don't know I can't remember anything from the day before. We talked brought the car in and it was fixed exactly on the day promised and with extreme attention to detail.  Well you would think that would be it but low and behold 1 month later my wife is hit from behind and so back to Integrity we go.  I got an estimate, filed the claim and they began work thinking this would be a clear cut case of acceptance of liability.  Oh no nothing goes as planned so our car was ready and we are in a rental but the insurance company tells me they can't determine fault just yet and that when they do they will only cover the rental car for 3-4 days well we are on day 7.  So, I called Integrity and put them to the test and my first impression of Fidel and Oscar and asked if they would release our car to us until the insurance fiasco is resolved.  I told them I would leave them a credit card for insurance that the repairs would get paid if the insurance company in 7-8 days doesn't pay for damages.. Holy Crap they said with out hesitation or reservation yes they would because they take care of their customers.  What they did to help us out and relieve some of the frustration and financial burden we will have was absolutely with out a doubt amazing and very well appreciated.  Amazing company who truly does have INTEGRITY and are HONEST individuals who do believe in the old adage of taking care of your customers because they will take care of you.  CUSTOMER FOR LIFE....GREAT JOB and Thanks.< /Text>< rate>

My vehicle was totaled, but their service went beyond repairing the vehicle.  They were my advocate in regards to dealing with the insurance companies and provided sound guidance throughout the process.  They really know their stuff!  I highly recommend their services!</Text>

They also coerced me to download the Yelp app and give them a 5 star rating because "they were helping me out". There are plenty of other auto body spots in Fairfield.... Find another one besides Integrity Auto Collision Center Incorporated.< /review>< Pics>

Then I did my homework on google and found Integrity Auto, made an appointment with them to see my car and since the moment I came into their store I felt welcome they treated me with respect and fixed my car perfectly. kept me updated on the process Thank you Integrity for great work on my car, I higgly reccomend any one that is involved in a car accident to come and see them.

I strongly recommend Integrity Auto Collision for any repairs. This is the third time I take my car to them. It took only one time to know that they do everything possible to help you as a customer. Other shops make the insurance companies the preference, but here, it's all about you the customer. All the staff is super friendly and helpful. Thanks to them I've had bad incidents be good experiences, because they always leave my car looking amazing. This shop may not be the closest to my home, but it's definitely worth the drive to Fairfield. So whenever life decides to throw you a curve, and you end up in a vehicle accident, absolutely be sure to visit Integrity Auto Collision. You won't have any regrets. Also be sure to ask for Oscar or Jenny, they will definitely lead you in the right direction.<//text>

Had Jennifer as the main person handling the repair on my vehicle. I am SO grateful for integrity and for Jennifer working so hard to make sure my vehicle was restored to pre accident conditions and that the work on it was done correctly. They did an amazing job and returned my vehicle to the original manufacturers condition. They kept me informed of everything that was going on and didn’t let the insurance company take advantage of me and what they wanted to do to “fix” the damage. They are really the best in this area and are mopar certified. Thank you again so much!!

I was in my first car accident, I hit a pole...ugh. I took it to Integrity and was very surprised. Oscar walked me through the steps that would take to fix my car. Oscar and the whole staff was very helpful and very friendly. Integrity will have my business for now on and I will be sending my friends to them as well.

I HIGHLY recommend them to everyone.<//review>

<Text>I recently got rear ended and had to find a place to get my car fixed, I yelped body shops and integrity is the first place that came up so I clicked it and read all the reviews, every review was about a positive experience the customer had. So I figured I would go check them out and see what they were all about. When I got there Oscar checked out my car, explained to me what they had to offer and I immediately was sold. He got in contact with a rental car company and the insurance and I didn't have to do anything but give him the information and my keys. He handled everything for me, which I definitely appreciate with all my heart because I really didn't have time to be doing everything. They really are the best in town!! Keep up the great work!! (:

< review>
I came here to get a new front bumper and door on my Acura TLX based off the reviews from Yelp and Google. Greg started working with me right away and was transparent about everything they were going to do with the car. My car was in the shop for 5 days, exactly how long Greg said it would be. Greg also called me throughout the week to keep me posted, since there was some issues with my insurance and because I was trying to get the work done ASAP.

The workmanship on my car was top notch and they even gave it a beautiful wax job and vacuumed the interior. It probably looks better today than the day I bought it.

I do not have a single complaint or suggestion for them. Every aspect of their business was on point and I always felt I was in good hands. I can honestly say that their customer service was the best out of any business I've been to anywhere in the last six months (at least).

Thanks Greg & team @ Integrity for going above and beyond!!</review>

A GREAT EXPERIENCE FROM START TO QUICK FINISH

First of all, let me start by saying that this team is absolutely amazing. Jennifer handled most everything and I am soooo grateful for her. I love my car and get very nervous ever leaving it or in the possession of someone else. I wasn't worried about them, probably because I was being put up to date with everything. This team contacted me more than my own insurance. Also, they kept in contact with me through email AND phone. They truly care about how their customers feel and take into account what the customer wants not what your insurance wants.
EVEN when your insurance wants things to be easier they will still fight for you and what you, as their client wants no matter how much harder it may be. In my case, they lost some money that could have been made just to make sure my lousy insurance was happy and not putting parts that wouldn't fit correctly on my vehicle. They truly make you feel as a valued customer and even one of the team in the process. Down to every phone call, they introduced me to the team. Kept me up to date on every single little detail, pulled the strings they could where they could, and to top it off detailed my vehicle. and not the once over wipe down most places do but every nook and cranny were as clean as the day I picked it up off the lot. Not to mention the outside of the vehicle.
Even after picking up my vehicle from them which didn't take that long BTW they reached out to make sure everything was still in great condition. I love the job they did and words can not repay the way I felt every time I reached for the phone and Integrity was calling. YES RELIEF! THANK YOU SO MUCH Jennifer, Oscar, and Maggie and the rest of the Integrity team for making this as pleasant as possible.</text>

The shop itself is very clean, the staff are friendly, the work they do is fast and efficient. I made 5 estimates in the Fairfield area, and they came out the cheapest. Thanks again, Oscar!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1505232810871, 'text': 'Thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve you, wish you the best always! -Team Integrity'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

The best thing I did was make sure my car was inspected by their insurance company at the Integrity Body Shop and not at my house or work. Then Integrity took care of all the back and forth with The General on our behalf including making sure that the car had OEM parts on it when The General did want to pay for them and spec'd used/junk yard parts for the car. Really high quality work also on the vehicle - we paid for the paint restoration to happen at the same time and WOW the car is beautiful!

I just had some vandalism done to my mini van and needed to look for a body shop near Vallejo and came to Integrity because of the good reviews. =) I absolutely loved the service, it was a stress less experience. =) They took care of everything from dealing with the insurance to the car rental. =) I totally recommend this body shop; they are nice and professional!!!!</Review>

<Text>Fortunately, I didn't need collision repair however I was looking for a quality detail on my 2010 X5 and Integrity provided the best paint refinish (detail) that I have ever experienced! Their technician removed all of the black swirls that "other professionals" put there. They brought back to life the black trim which was sun damaged and had wax compound left behind from others. I use to take it to the dealer in NJ and they were terrible. Locally, I tried a reputable car wash center and they made a mess of it. Following those debacles, I personally visited 3 places that had great reviews on Yelp and Integrity Auto Collision impressed me the most. Greg greeted me, looked over the vehicle, offered a fair estimate, told me they would need it two full days and showed me around the facility. The entire process was seamless and I cannot emphasize enough how happy we are with our car!  Thank you Integrity!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Getting into an auto accident is never fun and dealing with the repairs can be even less enjoyable.   Integrity Auto Colision of Fairfield simplified the process and made the entire ordeal as streamlined and efficient as possible.   Greg was thorough and explained the repair process in great detail.  No hidden fees and an honest and fair estimate.
This is how a business should be managed! They finished ahead of schedule and provided feedback along the way.  I have nothing but praise.  Thank you.< /Review>

Nothing can compare to how professional and helpful integrity is, the process on fixing the scratch that my neighbor did on my car was seriously the easiest, drop of my car on a monday and i was already picking it up a week after, my car looks brand new and seems like nothing ever happened, i totally recommend integrity over any other body shop! Thank you so much to Oscar for a great Customer Service..!<//review>

Unfortunately, this is my 3rd car I take here... lol but there’s a reason why I’m still going to this particular shop!
Had an accident on my 2017 Camaro, and I knew I can count on the integrity group to take care of my baby! Nothing but quality work and quality people in here. All OEM parts! (Hard to find a shop that does that). Place is clean, nice and well organized. They kept me posted throughout the whole process, which I loved. And gave me pictures of all the work done on my car.
Picked up my car today and couldn’t be more happy... can’t even tell it was ever hit! Thank you guys for an awesome job!< /review>

Came by to get a guess-timate on a headlight restore and clear coat. They took the time to clean it up for 2 hours of their time and gave me a for sure answer and also advice on which direction I should go. Definitely earns their reputation! I'll be a returning customer!<//review>

<Review>I have my 2014 Chevy Silverado done in this place.  My experience dealing with their staff are nothing but wonderful.  They make sure that they use an OEM parts for my truck.  They also go above and beyond to bring my truck in an original condition before collision.  I would NOT hesitate to recommend this place to bring your vehicle for repair.  Job done right and it's on time as they promised.

I been in multiple accidents in the last 3 years and have gone to prefered shops that my insurance company have sent me to and have not been satified. I decided to give Integrity Auto Collision a try and was the best thing I could have done, they treaded me really good way better than any other body shop in town.  I learned that Integrity does not sign contracts with insurance therefor they work for the customes best intrest and I like that. So if you are looking for a body shop make sure the body shop works for you and not the insurances.  The people at Integrity were very helpfull from begining to end, repairs on my car were perfect my car looks great Integrity is the best.< /text>

I needed some help fixing a scratched up paint job, and Oscar took care of it even on a weekend on his own time!!!  The shop is immaculate, you can eat off the floors!  And the shop cars  OMG, these are show winners.  Oscar's knowledge of body repair all the way up to the prestine and highly controlled Audi programs is nothing but impressive.  He is in tune with what the manufacturers demand in a body frame repair shop and that same knowledge is solidified in all the staff.  Walking into their office is nothing short of walking into a high tech company.  These guys really care and Oscar and company care about each other making sure all that cross his doors have a great experience for mechanics and customers.  These guys care and no one in the entire surrounding area comes close.  I want Integrity from my repair shops and definitely found it at Integrity Auto Collision Center!!!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1505232688913, 'text': 'Thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve you, wish you the best always! -Team Integrity'}</Response>< gmapID>

Im from vacaville and i got into a minor car crash this past weekend so i took my BMW M4 there so they fix the big dent infront of my car..also they check and fixed minors details that i didnt know my car had...plus the way they treat their clients is excelent..very friendly place and very clean. I definately would recommend it to everyone!!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x8085141569c29f3d:0x9d02d1e9587ba34c</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My vehicle was parked in a garage, and unfortunately was hit by the person parked next to me when they opened there door. As a result, it left about a 3 inch crease on the side panel. After I reported it to my insurance company, they gave me the list of shops that were covered thru them. I yelped them all and none of them had 5 star reviews. Im all about great reviews.
I continued my search for a local shop that had 5 stars, and Integrity Auto came up. I called them, and ended speaking with Oscar, and the rest is history. This shop lives up to there name. They do Quality work, and go above and beyond to make there clients very happy. Again, i brought my car in to just have the crease fixed, I picked it up today and the car looks brand new. They even touched up a few of the rock chips and scratches that were on the car. Amazing! If your from Solano County and need body work, look no further. Thanks Oscar and Team!!<//Text>< Pics>

Many many thanks to Jennifer and Oscar for the top notch repairs and for being so accommodating to our schedule (bringing the car from San Francisco ...). The paint match is perfect and repairs completed on target with the estimate and a couple of days early!!! We will definitely be back as needed. Integrity is an experience worth repeating even if the reason for it isn't.   Muchas muchas gracias!!!    Jim, Paco, & Perlita< /review>

Harriett, my wife, got her car back, yesterday, from the body shop!  Integrity Auto Collision Center, Inc of Fairfield,  CA did a fabulous job.  They even washed the car, cleaned the interior and cleaned the tires!  It looks like a new car!</Review>

I took my car to Integrity Auto Collision Center last week to have some work done and all I have to say is when they named their company Integrigy, that was an understatement!! They went above and beyond my expectations! I have never been treated with such respect and thoughtfulness. Not to mention the amazing work they did to my car. AND, when I got my car back, it was spotless!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! If you ever need any work done to your car, body or machanical, do yourself a favor and visit Integrity Auto Collision Center in Fairfield, CA. You'll be glad you did!!! Thank you Fidel and Hank!!!

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>My daughter and I love Mountain Mike's Pizza because of the quality and taste of their food. Their pizza dough is always perfectly baked and we are addicted to their churros too! The Cleveland store has a really nice patio that has a nice and warm family ambience. Whenever we think of pizza, Mountain Mike's is the first thing that comes to our mind.<//review>< user_name>

It's a chain so the recipes are reliable, however paying $35 dollars for a pizza that omits half of my toppings is a joke that I won't be experiencing again. Staff needs to pay attention to the order they are making. Reading is not difficult.<//text>

They never waivered in their intent to rebuild from the fires that devastated so many here in Sonoma County.

I don't eat here. The organizations that I belong to and friends like to go here. I sit and watch them eat because I'm keto. I've asked them to please serve me hot water so that I can at least broth with an avacado while I'm there but they refuse me hot water or say they don't have hot water.

I still attend meetings here on a weekly or monthly bases.</Text>

Not particularly clean and subpar service. Food is about as good as the service, plus the bonus of upsetting your stomach. Stay away from the salad bar.</text>

<Review>Came here the first night they opened and the wait time for the pizza was LONG even know there was 1 other customer .  Then when asked about the pizza they brought out some other order.   The employee goes in the back and gets our order and shows it to use and you can tell it was sitting for some time .  The cheesy bread was extremely hard.  Came here again about a month later still the wait time it a joke.  Came here just today to try again and waiting 45mins for a med. Pizza and some cheesy sticks. Meanwhile people that came in after us and placed an other recieved their pizza.  Wont be going back to this location.<//Review><Rating>1</Rating>< time>

Customer service was outstanding. They even added on a free coupon without me having one beforehand to make my total price cheaper. Their buffet is more than reasonable and is always fresh out of the oven.< /review>

< Review>
Tasty pizza. Wouldn't return to dine in though. One of the employees was having a rough day and made it clear with her tone of voice and body language towards customers and co-workers that she was pissed off. It made for an unpleasant dining experience and she was unnecessarily rude towards me and a friend when we asked her to leave the order number on the table as we had more food coming.< /Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>Ordered a Mikes Pizza last night, it was a large cheese and pepperoni. It took about 35 minutes to be delivered, which was OK I was for warned it would be a while. When it arrived it was overcooked and the meat was very, very salty, they may have cut back on the sauce, because it was very dry. It tasted like it was cooked  earlier in the evening, needless to say I was not happy, and only ate 2 small pieces and the garbage can ate the remander. Maybe no  more Mikes Pizza for me....sorry...</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Nice clean place with consistency theme of snowflakes.  Taiwanese ice meets bubble tea meets hand rolled ice cream.  Visual appeal of hand rolled ice cream with open air style kitchen looks good.  We arrived around 2:30 so we didn't see anyone getting food but the menu looked simple and good.  Hand rolled ice cream looked and tasted good just like the presentation.  They also use five star rewards system and take credit card charges above $10.  The kids really enjoyed the show.</Review>

<text>The wait to receive our order was a little long but its understandable because of the process of making the ice cream treats. Nicely decorated atmosphere. You're able to see how they prepare the ice cream because they have their station near the front counter. Customer service was good.</text>< gmapID>

<review>Pretty good place, the staff were friendly and the service was prompt. Dairy free alternatives for those who are lactose intolerant. The ice shave and rolls were very interesting to watch and made the taste of the food better.

Overall would come again as their prices were reasonable with great service.< /review><date>1552617846718</date>< rating>

<rating>1< /rating><UserId.>101846807175206862214< /UserId.><review>Tried to order from this place twice. Once on door dash and once on grub hub. Both times I got notified my order had been canceled after waiting for more than 30mins thinking my food would be coming.

Food here might be good but the service is terrible. I work at a restaurant that uses these online ordering platforms. There is no reason it should take that long to confirm or cancel an order that comes in. If it happened only once I would have let it go. Why be on these platforms if you aren’t going to fulfill customer orders.< /review>< pictures>

Everything came out one at a time about 5-10 minutes apart. Cheese sticks came out almost immediately. Then snow. Then snow. Then chicken. Then pudding. Then rolled. Then rolled. Mine came out last and I'm a slow eater so everyone was done long before I was.  This was my second time with the same thought. Slow service with not great timing.
I had the rolled deserts. It is not as heavy and creamy as other places but still, in all, they have really amazingly light and refreshing treats.

Over all it's DELISH. I would never tell someone to not go there. It's worth the try!

Pictured is the cherry chocolate rolled desert.<//review>< Date>

Stopped in for my first time and WOW, very surprised.  Good variety of teas, food, desserts, very reasonable prices....it's a little "hole in the wall" that you might not notice.  From the outside, it lacks curb appeal and their signage doesn't do them any favors, but once inside, it's average and the lack of ambiance is offset by their menu and helpful staff.  We tried it because it was late night and had few options....will definitely be going back.  Girlfriend had lemon tea, I had coconut milk tea with pearls, both were good.<//text>

This is for the service received, we had a party of five on a Saturday night, 8pm. Didn't even take five steps in and a little Asian girl came running to my face and asked for here or to go? I said for here, and she wanted me to put my name on a receipt paper.  All the tables were taken and seemed like they were waiting for their food, so we decided to just place an order to go, and they said 15-20 minutes.  Came back after at 20 mins and only order ready was crepe, I had way better crepe, it was cold, crepe was hard. Kept asking where is the rest? they look away or starts talking with other host. Over an hour has passed and they say they are making it now! Ice cream was good, but unless there are NOBODY in the store, expect to wait over an hour!< /review>

<text>Had the QQ milk ice with egg pudding and boba. It was delicious! Other tea places usually blend milt tea and ice to get the smoothie-like texture... normally all the ice makes the drink watery, but not here. Would definitely go back.

Did try their strawberry bannana smoothie on my second visit; found it to be a bit icy for my liking. The apple green tea was a bit strong on the tea side as well. Will be sticking to the QQ milky ice.< /text>< Pictures>

The place is very mediocre. The ice cream is RIDICULOUSLY over-priced, and that is an understatement. We paid $35.00 for 4 dishes of ice cream that was worth maybe $10.00 #SMH</review>

It was my first time at this urgent care and I must say i was impressed with its cleanliness and so happy it was open 24 hours.
I would have given it 5 stars because the Doctor was so sweet and made me feel comfortable, but the male nurse had zero personality.  He was very matter of fact and seemed annoyed to be there.  Maybe he was having a bad day!  I will def go there again.<//review>

<Text>Had an appointment with Concentra walked in was greeted by nurses at the front desk. One of the did  acknowledged to the ones that were waiting that someone will be right with them. The nurse who walked me back for my procedure introduced herself &  walked me  through step by step as to what's going to happen & what to expect after my situation. Came back for my follow-up was greeted same thing acknowledged.
Awesome place to do business!<//Text><name>bridgette vaults< /name>< Date>

I was there for a physical regarding job employment.  Ruffin Rd. Office suite 100.
I can NOT give them a high enough rating. The Doctor in charge of my Physical was kind, informative, and everything that I would expect a Doctor to be. I was dismayed when she thanked me for being nice patient.  Apparently,  she sometimes deals with jerks.
And my Nurse took my blood with little to no pain. Seriously,  2nd LEAST painful ever. And my blood is drawn every 6 months.< /text>

Awful and unfriendly receptionists too busy watching reality tv on television in the waiting room.  Please go to another clinic for worker's comp issues tb tests, drug testing, etc.<//review>< pics>

The staff was very unprofessional.They genuinely had no idea what they were talking about and I was never seen by an actual physician. Gave me false x-ray results then was informed there would actually be no results for 24 hours since they did not have someone on site to read x-rays and my injury was still misdiagnosed. Overall useless visit and poor experience.<//review>

The overall experience wasn’t bad, however, there was a lot of waiting. My appointment was at 3:30pm, waited in the reception area until about 4:30pm, and didn’t leave my exam until after 6pm. The staff was kind and professional but I am giving a 3 star review based on the fact that, although I had an appointment, I had to wait for and hour just to finally be seen.< /text>

I decided to go late at night hoping it would not be as busy as day time hours. I was right going at midnight I was the only person in the place. My nurse was extremely nice and professional.

Everything was okay EXCEPT being left in a room for what seemed like forever with hardly any clothing on. The room was very cold and consequently I was too. I thought that was a pretty messed up thing to do by the nurse or medical assistant that was giving me the physical. That was completely inexcusable.</review>

I kind of twisted and fell on my foot. i was swollen and painful and possibly broken. I arrived at Concentra just past 9:00 am. Registration was easy enough (including checks for COVID) and there were about 8 people already there for help. Staff was very nice.  About two hours after I arrived a nurse took me to a small room to take my vitals and told me they had already called  in for  another physician to see patients as only one doctor was present. After another two hours of waiting during which no attempt was made to let me know approximately how much longer it would take or if another doctor had arrived to help out. I saw several people who arrived much later than myself get called in to see a doctor.  So it certainly wasn’t a first come first served process. Several hours after I arrived they offered a wheelchair to me which i thought was a compassionate act. Five hours after arrival I was taken to a room wherein I had to wait another 45 minutes before the doc arrived and  when she did, she apologized for the long wait and waisted little time examining me and then sending me off for an x-ray several doors down the hall. the results took another 20 minutes but were questionable so a review was conduct by a specialist.  that took another 20 minutes or so but it was good news: no fracture. The doc offered some alternatives but I chose  a simple ace compression wrap. Checkout was instantaneous.

Besides the physician understaffing and resulting five hour wait, I found the staff snd the doctor to be competent, courteous and compassionate.  They just needed their employer to not be so cheap with staffing.

On a final note, it looked like the place took COVID precautions but there’s always at least
one  in the crowd who has to act stupidly. In this case it was a a rather huge
middle aged man, sloppily clad and rather loud. He seemed to think that covering his mouth only while exposing his nostrils to mother nature and the rest of the people in the waiting room was just fine and dandy. Why even wear a mask if you refuse to do so properly? Placing a paper mask just over your mouth while exposing your germ laden nostrils doesn’t do any good. You might just as well wear it like a thong for all the good that does. I shot him some dart-like looks but he couldn’t care less.  Unfortunately, staff never said a single word to him about it. Next
time they should say something to protect
themselves and the patients in the waiting room.  Why should we risk infection to appease someone who still thinks COVID 19 to be a hoax?<//text>

Came in for my appointment and was told it would be a 4 hour wait! They said they take walk-ins in between appointments. Okay, well I’ll reschedule. Asked if I could come early for my appointment to secure my spot in line, they said yes. I show up at 7am monday morning and check in, get all my paperwork filled out. I am now the last person in the waiting room (over an hour later) and at LEAST 10 people have been called before me. I asked what was up, and they told me everyone else had an appointment before me! Really? All these people had an appointment between 7 and 8am? Seems like my appointment didn’t matter before, but now other people’s times matter. What’s the point of making an appointment if they literally mean nothing? Never again. I would rather pay for all the tests than deal with this extremely unprofessional place.</review>< pics>

The worst urgent care I have been to except for the doctor who saw me he was very polite and apologetic first I had my appointment at 1:00  I got there at 12:40 I waited around for over 2 hrs before I was even acknowledged and only because I ask one of the staff members if there was a problem because everyone was attended except for me and I let her know I had a appointment at 1 and it was now 3!!! The front desk lady the one who took my information at the beginning she totally forgot about me yes it was a little busy but everyone who got there at the same time was gone and another group came and went! So I had a tb test done and had to go to urgent care on Ruffin road only to find out that the mission valley front staff had totally forgot to have me sign a document that ask if you had tested positive or had any reaction to the vaccine if they would have done their job at the mission valley office they would have known I do have a alérgic reaction and  thee test required chest x rays instead of shot but of course once again the did not do their job and I ended up signing the form at the urgent care on Ruffin rd with the date that I was in mission valley I guess so they can cover their selves and so I had to go back another time for x rays now and now I’m still not employed and waiting by the way my exam was for my new job all I’m saying is these front desk ladies need to be more focus!!!!</Text>

Well I have time to write this review while I wait to be seen for my appointment. I was here on time for an appointment I made last week. ONE HOUR in and I've seen three people that came after me go back (maybe it's for different things) but it's just a health screen that should take 10min max.  I ask the people up front when we will be seen and no apology just “it will be a few more minutes”. I just talked to a guy sitting next to me who said he's been waiting 1 1/2 hours past his appointment.  Save yourself the wait and find a place with better reviews.</Review>

I am in/out quick, not much waiting.  Staff and Dr. are good, they also follow up due to symptom still persist.  I wish I can find a family doctor like them.<//Review>

Went for a drug screening. Called before coming in because I wanted to make a reservation or appointment but was told they can help me when I show up. Signed in and filled the documents but it took more than an hour for my name to be called. I just think it shouldn’t take that long for this.<//text>

This place is relatively worthless.. The receptionist up the front are doing their nails chewing their gum and on social media. okay no attention to the clients. The back office nursing staff was excellent it. Personable responsive and caring about their job. Unfortunately the doctor did one of the fastest cheapest least thorough physicals I've ever had.. if you're really interested in getting medical care, do not go here<//Text>

< review>
In all honesty, if I could give less than one star I would. From the time I got there I was left standing in the hallway outside the door while I was transferred to three different people because the sign on the door said if I had a cough or a sore throat I had to call a number before walking in. once the door was opened I was rushed through the waiting room area into a room in the back that was basically deserted and left in an examination room alone with no human contact whatsoever for at least a half an hour before someone brought me paperwork. After that, I sat there for 35 minutes waiting for someone to pick up the paperwork they had given me. Then, I was then told I had to make my co-payment, which left me questioning what I was paying for. I was then told it would only be a few minutes before someone saw me, which turned into well over 45 minutes before somebody came back eventually to see me. All in all I was there for over two and a half hours and the person who did end up seeing me spent about 10 minutes with me, didn't allow me to finish a sentence because he kept cutting me off in the middle of my explanations, and started leaving the room before he even checked my ear which was part of my complaint on the paperwork I had filled out. He then looked in my ear and said oh yeah you have an infection let me give you some antibiotics. That was my entire visit. I will never go back there again nor will I have any member of my family go back there again.< /review>

<Review>I was brought back to the room and waited over 2 hours, very concerned about how I was feeling. No one seemed to care as the staff was so busy interacting with other patients, letting them know how many people were to be seen before it was their turn.  My door was kept closed with no interaction whatsoever. When I opened the door the Dr seemed surprised I was even there. I ended up leaving without being seen. There's nothing worse than being made to feel invisible, except being sick and afraid in an environment where empathy and compassion are woefully absent. I won't be back.</Review><time>1604355891496< /time></record>

When I go in for TB testing I usually get the x-ray done. The nurses went back and forth with me about getting the skin test done. I tested positive with TB when I was a baby and then was treated and then received chest x-rays since then. I'VE NEVER HAD TO TAKE THE SKIN TEST AGAIN. So these nurses talked to the doctor and the doctor stated I need a skin test. If it's all across the board that you don't give someone a skin test that has tested positive before then why recommended the skin test? They could've easily asked for me to return with my records but they clearly didn't care. Next time follow your standard rules and have ppl bring in their records don't just administer a test knowing they've already tested positive before. 🤬🤬🤬🤬</review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I was seen on Thursday 7/23/20 @ 1030 pm.  The wait was about 45 minutes and I received exceptional care from the PA that evaluated me.  She was very nice Asian lady that was very knowledgeable and professional.   I am a nurse myself and most of the time I'd rather see a PA over an MD.  I was also evaluated again on Monday 7/27/20 at 2 am with the same PA.  Once again, exceptional service.  The Medical Assistant for both visit also provided great service.  My only negative comment has to do with the facility.  The intercom was out of service and it took a little time to get in.  I am very impressed with the service and I would highly recommend this location for any urgent needs.
Just an fyi:  I would not recommend La Mesa or Chula Vista locations.  Both facilities tried to send me to the Emergency Room  because they didn't have time to see me.<//Text><user>104524261948554834236< /user>< Pics>

Waiting time is very long I was there for over three hours and by the time I was seen by a physician for the physical check I was waiting in the room freezing cold while wearing the gown and I was almost ready to put my clothes back on and walk out of there. They need a better system while having patients wait to be seen.</Text>

<date>1604951442944</date><Review>I like the people at Concentra. Everything went well for my commercial driver's license physical untill an apparent test was skipped. I wear contacts and I needed to retake the eye exam/ reading the letters without my contacts after passing with 20/20. The hiccup of having to wait for a retest after all other parts of physical were done took awhile. That being said, I can't help being a bit disgruntled about having to take a test that I know I will fail. There is a reason I am wearing contacts to see, I need them. It is so stated on my license. Being tested in this way is not a problem with Concentra. The only problem with Concentra here is that it took extra long to get this done. I would go back to Concenta again. Way to long of a review, I know  😉< /Review>< Response>

Firstly, i am not the type to write reviews.. but I am afraid if i do not say this.. this clinic will continue to be as bad as it is.. Being that i am also a Medical Assistant, i feel like alot of things went on that was totally not okay, cause i know how a clinics flow is supposed to be. I went to this clinic for Pre-Employment Requirements.. drug testing, TB test, physical all of that.. and i was there 3 hours. I was called back maybe 30-45 minutes of me being there.. when i finally get called back. No vitals were taken,  10-25  minutes of being in the room... a MA comes in, he has a kit filled with injections, blood draw supplies, no consent forms for any of the test. he ignores the fact that i told him i have a better vein in my right arm, still sticks my left and gets no blood return. and i have to be stuck again.. he takes about 10 minutes tops doing everything & after that I am in the room for another 10-15 minutes and than taken do the drug screening, the girl walks me down to do it. i get sent back to my room.. another 45 minutes to a  hour goes by, i peek out of the room to see if i see someone i can ask about where the Nurse Practitioner may be, or if i am next to be seen.. another 20-30 minutes, goes by, and finally the Nurse Practitioner walks in, she starts going through the computer and notices that i am not in her computer, meaning i have no chart. So they spend 15 minutes trying to do that.. one of the MA's then comes and asks me did i sign some form, i did not sign cause it was never given to me..so they make me sign a couple forms, which should've been given to me initially, and than my vitals are taken.. mind you at this point i have been here 2 hours. Just now getting my vitals taken. Finally the NP comes back in and gives the world most fastest physical.. barely really checked anything... wouldn't call it a physical. she rushed it because she knows i'd already been there so long.. but you do not just rush a physical like that.. now it is 11/04/2020 i call the clinic to check the status of my tests.. and they have lost pretty much everything. The employee I spoke with, casually said my urine was lost in transit. Totally unacceptable. Also my physical paperwork was lost.. they do not have anything.. i had to reach out to my employer and ask for another authorization form so that everything can be done again.. pushing back my start date for this job. Overall i am super upset with the way things went there & now no results of any kind. and i am supposed to go back here for the same treatment pretty much. I hope this place gets better... would never work here.<//text>

Everyone was nice and respectful, except the doctor she was very disrespectful and unprofessional. I myself work in healthcare and was very disappointed with my visit this time around. It was not my first time there But it was my first time getting attended by that doctor. She made me feel uncomfortable and she also made me feel like she didnt care about my health she was questioning me like if i had done something wrong. She had an attitude the whole time and she was speaking to her coworkers the same way. She sent someone to come and discharge me with paperwork without her even coming back into the room and telling me my diagnosis. I will not recommend her as a doctor.< /Review>

<text>My appointment was for a urinalysis. I completely understand the long wait at a clinic or hospital. This happeded that day amd myself and several other Officers waited patiently. When the Nurse approached us she called out my last name while still walking never even looking in my direction. Then once i followed her she was very short with me and seemed to be in a bad mood. I almost asked if she waa ok. I understand when someone has a bad day but that is something that should be left at home in my opinion.<//text><Response>None<//Response><pics>None</pics>< user>

<text>In specialty care, I always have a positive experience. If I have an issue they take the time to figure it out and try to remedy the situation. In the least help me understand what it why things are happening the way they are. This helps me tremendously. I have not had this experience before in other healthcare places.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Took 3 hours for a follow up appointment, most of which was spent waiting. The worst was waiting an hour in a freezing exam room. Asked for blanket or something but they had nothing. They did move me to a “less freezing” room. Was in pain from the tension of the cold. Didn’t help my injury  situation at all.</text>< pics>

<Review>I didn't have an appointment but I was seen fairly quickly. I arrived at 5pm and check in was easy. There were a few forms to fill out, but was quickly taken to the back to have all the pre-employment work up completed. The staff was fast and efficient where I was able to get drug test done, N95 fit test, and a physical completed. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. I also liked the waiting room where they provided water and a television for the crowd.< /Review>< pictures>

Worst staff. On a HOLIDAY WEEKEND they are running with 1 provider. Took my husband over 2 hours to get a follow up on his finger and a new bandage put on. When i called the people there were not apologetic about the wait time and their excuse is that they only have 1 provider. Poor planning on their part. We would have gone elsewhere if he didn't have to go to this place per his work.<//review>

The worst service ever.
I consider this this place is unsafe during the pandemic. The waiting room was full of people waiting. The appointment they give is for holding people waiting 1 - 2 hours until beung seen....
They're so so slow.</text>

<review>The employees were very nice and very helpful but the wait was unreal. I was not seen until 2 hrs and 15 min past my appointment time. I work in healthcare so I understand running behind but don’t let people make appointments if you can’t see them within 30 minutes of the time. The place could have been more efficient.</review>< user_name>

<review>Poor young lady at the reception area. She was by herself answering phones, attending to walk ins, sorting out paperwork, dealing with rude coworkers. The place is unorganized with everyone doing something else. My question is, if the medical field is in such high demand, why aren’t there more more so the place can run smoothly?</review>< pics>

Concentra is very crowded, the employees are rude and a routine appointment for a TB test took almost an hour because everyone else goes first. There were way too many patients there on Saturday morning when I went back to have it read and the girl who helped me with the paperwork asked if I’d had the test done there two days earlier because she couldn’t find my chart. It was her writing in the piece of paper that I handed her. People don’t seem to care at concentra. I hope to never have to have a test there again of any kind just because it took so long.</text>

<Text>Over all it was a good experience.   The only complaint I have is the time it took me to see a physician .   I waited for over 2 hours to see a physician.   Also they entered my height wrong.  I am 6’1” and for some unknown reason they put me down as being 5’11”.     However the staff was very friendly and polite.< /Text>< Pics>

This is the 2nd time I've been to the CONCENTRA on Rufin Rd in San Diego. Both time a nightmare. Both times had appts. Both times it took over an hour to get back after appt time.  Neither time did a staff member let me know what the delay was. Nursing staff and Physician were great. Facility was clean. And organized. Therapy staff excellent.<//Review>

<Review>Front staff when you first walk in very rude , don't greet you giggling back and forth speaking Spanish and more giggling. Talking about patients out loud. Slamming phone receiver after every hang up. Slamming files into awaiting bins. Just not professional!! Patients already coming in hurt or not feeling good and then have to put up with that??? Making the patients feel like we're inconveniencing the staff ... I cringe every time I have to go in for a follow-up.<//Review><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

I had to go for a pre-employment physical and TB test.  Because I work full time, it helped that this clinic has extended hours and were quick and efficient when I came back to have my TB test read.  They sent all the paperwork over to my job so it made the whole experience pretty seamless.<//Text>

Stand in line no eye contact even tho I was the only one there . Then seem annoyed when you check in .  Still no eye contact and then talk in Spanglish to each other in front of you .. also talking smack about the medical assistant out loud .

<text>The front desk lady, I didn’t get her name but she had frizzy, nappy hair. She had us sit across the entire room where there were plenty of chairs spread out; to where we can sit wherever we chose but she insisted. Got discouraged that she had to disinfect the pens we used when, she truly had nothing better to do than watch TLC lol and her attitude was ugly as her personality. Not to mention some little boy names Cesar?? Had the same attitude. 🙃 misery doesn’t look good in you two.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Seemed as good as a 24/7 urgent care facility could be with no appointment.

I went in for a physical and drug screen for employment.  VERY NICE AND CLEAN facility. I had no problems at all in fact they had to tell me it was time to leave and I was done.. Staff was very WELCOMING, made me feel really relaxed and at home...The testing was not difficult nor was the wait. I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO GO TO FOR ANY MEDICAL NEEDS  OR TESTING!!!</Text>

< Review>
Went in for an infected cut on my finger that was getting increasingly worse.  Staff was super nice, but the antibiotics they prescribed made the infection and pain worse. Ended up going to a different urgent care today to get a second opinion because my finger had swelled and I couldn't feel or move the end of it. Concentra misdiagnosed what was wrong and now I can't work for several days because of how bad my finger got before I received medication that would actually do something. Staff here was friendly though.< /Review>

<username>Jeff Arkulary< /username><text>This place keeps you waiting in the waiting room for the longest time. They did a rapid step on and it took them 32 minutes to get results. Rapid strep is a 5 min test. I waited 36 minutes to get discharged and another 20 for him to write up the discharge papers. I do not recommend coming here.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< userid>

Clean offices. Wasn't busy when I came on a weekday around 7pm. Staff could do with more professionalism. They just switched to Concentra from another company and are still getting used to the system, so a lot of huffing and puffing. When I corrected on some misinformation on my forms, I was told well I can fix it but I have to register you again, with a pause and a felt frustration as if I was to then give an out so as to not do it correctly. Also they're really concerned about their breaks. The physicians assistant was pleasant though.

I asked about this sign and she said she never read it and had no idea what they meant by it.< /Text>

I didn’t even bother going out there. The lady who answered the phone when I called was about as clueless as it gets. She thought they accepted
Medicare but didn’t know whether Medicare covered all of the visit or a percentage of it. But since their base price is $185 that is a piece of information is important enough that it is inexcusable for one of their employees not to know. I mean, what the hell is she there for, to turn off the lights in the bathroom before she goes home?<//review>

This is an awesome doctors office. Everyone is friendly and made me feel at home. The Doctor is the best. He has a great personality and genuinely cared about my concerns and went in depth about options to treat my ailments. The checkout process was amazing. I have a difficult schedule and they made every effort to accommodate my next appointment. I am truly happy I found such a great team. You guys rock!<//review>

Even though my company contracts for work physicals, they still make no attempt to get things done....  to be told to not make an appointment because it would still be the same wait time is worthless....  some of my co workers waited 4 hours for 20 minutes of tests...</review>

My overall experience was pretty good.. the gentleman at the counter was fast, efficient and straightforward. There’s a little bit of a wait which is to be expected if the doctor on duty is to give each patient personalized service.

Dr. Farewell assisted me. She was thorough and compassionate. Although, I was referred to the ER for the symptoms I was experiencing she was still very helpful.</review>

DO NOT COME HERE! IT IS HORRIBLE! They have a weird system with about 6 different colored folders. They appear to have a contract with local business because they saw only these workers while I waited. Sat and waited for over 3 hours for a simple physical and urine sample. Held my bladder for that whole time! I work in a trauma center in the ER and what they were doing made no sense. Again DO NOT COME HERE

Took them a long time to get my paperwork in order to even check me in!< /text>

< Review>
After tripping over a fellow employee’s extended leg and spraining my knee ( Sunday 03/01/2020), I was told to go to the Kearny Mesa urgent care. I arrived promptly at 1:30 pm, filled out appropriate paperwork and waited until almost 3pm before being called. Another hour passed after vitals were taken when Dr. Cross came in. Quick diagnosis revealed a sprained knee. X-rays followed and treatment explained. Waited almost another hour before given brace and cane. Told to ice, rest with leg elevated, take anti-inflammatory and use compression (wear leg brace).
Finally got out the door right around 5pm.
Came to find out that I was “cleared for modified duty” on same day I was injured!
Came to find out Doctors within this MPN can only authorize time off after surgery! I can’t walk let alone drive and how can I effectively treat swelling if I’m working? Makes no sense!! Can’t get bed rest if working!!
When I went in for follow-up today, (03/04/2020), my fiancé asked how can you not give time off for proper treatment? The attending physician said they are directed to return employees to modified duty unless they had surgery! Now I guess I have to retain an attorney, see another doctor (out of their network), and file a claim.
So, not only am I painfully injured, I have added stress about work, income, etc. . .
However, the one shining star is the Nurse by the name of Danica. She was Awesome!!<//Review>

<review>I give US Health physical therapy 5 stars. Katie is excellent. She is thorough and cares about her patients. She was always encouraging.

Doctor side:
What I do not like is my text reminders got turned off and couldn’t get turned back on and when I missed an appointment one was scheduled for me - I did not open the letter until after the missed appointment - thus missing another appointment.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Service is quick compared to other clinics I've been to, however reception seems to have a problem dealing with patients/customers. I don't understand why something so simple and so easy to do as to just greed people is so hard, as for the most important thing (service) it is a very good service.</Text>

The woman at the desk was very nice. I was there in the morning on a Sunday and there is no air conditioning and this is not acceptable for a healthcare facility where people that are sensitive to heat will go.

This needs to be fixed.< /Review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Negative stars if possible. My husband has been coming here for weeks due to an on the job vehicle accident. He has back pain and all they tell him is that it's a muscle issue. They make him go to physical therapy which only makes the pain worse. Yet every time he expresses this to the doctor she just blows him off and says it's just his muscles. Going to see a back specialist for a 2nd opinion. Overall, they just ignore all his complaints and have yet to help him. They wouldn't even give him anything for the pain.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>The office experience and the people I would actually give four out of five stars. They could be a little more prompt while I was in one of the patient waiting rooms. Because I feel that waiting 45 minutes is a little too long. But what I’m truly upset about is the Concentra in Oceanside sent me to Mission Valley closer to my house I arrive 20 minutes before closing nobody was in the waiting room and they would not except me. Mission Valley sent me to Hillcrest but by the time I got there it was 6 o’clock and then they would not except me. Hillcrest Sent me to Mira Mesa,  which runs 24 seven. I will never go to Mission Valley ever again that’s the second time they’ve turned me away the time before that I was there two hours before they close and they still would  not except me. They have very bad management there . I feel that if all of the organizations had an agreement that you should arrive three hours before closing that it would save people a whole lot of money and effort and time,  and each Concentra should know this about the other so they could properly direct people .</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dbffb2ccdac74b:0x8337366bd5420239<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Review>I called my daughters insurance company and they said I could bring her to urgent care here, only one open besides ERs. Drove 20 minutes. Call box wasn't working. They have a sign flapping in the wind with a phone number to call instead. Good thing I have a cell phone. Person that answered was not friendly. Same person at the front desk asked me what I was there for. I started to tell him about my sick daughter and he cut me off saying "we dont treat that young." He said they treat workmans comp and dont have equipment to accommodate my daughter. Nowhere on their website is it stated only adults are treated. What a waste of time and energy.</Review>< Resp>

I’ll start by saying, I would never use Concentra for anything in my life after this! This was my experience at the Kearny Mesa, CA location, but I’ve had a similar experience at the Murrieta, CA location, as well.

Unfortunately, the organization I am being hired on to uses them for their physicals. I was referred by HR to Concentra in mid-December. Concentra reps were supposed to reach out to me to set up an appointment, but it took me harassing HR who, in turn, had to harass Concentra for almost a month to get an appointment. Then, I show up and they don’t have my name on the list. They finally realized they messed up and told me to fill out some paperwork. I filled it out and was waiting for another 20 minutes when they asked me to fill out more paperwork. I had to use the restroom and the entire time I was out they left my paperwork with personal information on the top page on the check-in desk. I’m sure this is not a good practice when it comes to HIPAA. I was called back at 12:45 pm when I had a 12:00 pm appointment. Mind you, I had to take vacation time to have this appointment, so running over my requested time (which I did by an hour) wasn’t ideal. From there, they performed my medical exam and led me over to the Physical Therapist to do a physical exam. I had to get my blood pressure taken and lift a #40 box 3 times...and this took over 30 minutes to get me through. My experience left me with the feeling Concentra has no regard for a patient’s time or privacy. Both, of which, seem to be of the utmost importance when it comes to medical providers.

There are many other things that went wrong with this whole extravaganza, but I think most will get what they need from this review.<//Text>

They had me waiting for 3-4 hours just to do my physical. Had me a separate room for 30-45mins to get seen by the doctor and there wasn't anyone that came back to let me know what's going on. Poor service.</Review>

My last review was for U.S. HealthWorks Urgent Care on the Upper East Side. You'll see that my experience there was less than great. I had to come to this location for a simple procedure. I was seen very, very quickly. Staff was attentive and even went the extra mile to give me a letter confirming that my procedure was done. If I ever need to use U.S. HealthWorks Urgent CareI'll see to it that I use this location primarily.< /Text>

I understand having a long wait, but don't put the patients in a room unless they are next or will be seen soon. I waited almost 2 hours once I was in a patient room (plus 1 hour in the waiting room). When I finally saw the doctor he didn't even check my symptoms or anything, just prescribed a generic antibiotic after a 2 minute conversation.</Text>

Deangelo front desk signed me in and told me exactly what to expect for my visit and how long I would be there....next, Danika, nurse who performed some tests, amazingly kind and thorough, next, Jess Smith, PA who gave me a physical and he is a gem.  Wait time, virtually none...lastly, eye exam given by Luis who was patient! My experience was exceptional and if you need anything for work related testing, recommend Ruffin Rd. office! Thank you everyone.< /Review>

This place is truly awesome!! I was coming in from out of town, and was set up for a last minute appointment for a physical and a pre-employment drug test. They understood the urgency and we're very professional and courteous.<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Staff is polite but this is NOT walk-in urgent care. They do a bunch of other things a prioritize everything over urgent care. I signed in at 9:45 and have been waiting for two hours. They should not be pretending this is an urgent care, if you have a medical issue that you need care for you should go somewhere else.

Also they charge BEFORE they see you so you don't leave. This is the only place I've ever been to that charges before actually providing any service. They probably do it to keep you from leaving once you realize you've been waiting for hours. Scummy.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
3 hrs in, and my file was in the wrong place. I saw ppl who were walk-ins walk in after me and get helped before. I asked a back office person and desk rep and they said everything was fine to wait, while not checking my paperwork file. After the 3rd hour i spoke up to someone and they corrected the error.

Severe miscommunication, lack of empathy, poor customer service.< /Review>

<review>I went to this facility 2/17/19. I went in because I had been breaking out in hives since 2/15/19. The physician said he would send me two medications to the pharmacy. I drove all the way to the pharmacy and had nothing sent in. I called the facility nine times from 2/17/19-2/19/19 and I still have not received any meds. I spoke with a very rude lady named Teresa on the phone who said she would call me back and hung up without getting my name, DOB or telephone number. I called back and asked to speak to a supervisor, she then stated they were unavailable and she could not help me. It is now 2/19/19, I have no medications, I am still breaking out in hives if I don’t take Benadryl and will currently be going to another physician today just to receive medicine. I do not advise anyone to go to this facility. They are VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! I am a surgery coordinator at a doctors office and if any staff member treated a patient this way, they would be fired. They don’t even deserve the one star that was given. If I could give zero stars I would.</review>< Pictures>

Like other reviews this place is understaffed, you have to wait a long time. I went in for a cut to be stitched and they said stitches are $300 so they glued it and it would cost less. I get the bill in the mail and it's $500. I call Concentra and was told "We don't handle billing and I can't answer any of your billing questions, call this number." I've called the number a few times now and it goes straight to voicemail but gives you the option to have a representative help you pay your bill so I click that option and it also goes straight to voicemail and tells you THEY DON"T HANDLE BILLING YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE CONCENTRA YOU VISITED. What a scam. Get the run around from everyone and your bill is due in 15 days. Never go here without insurance, emergency room probably would have been cheaper.< /Review>

There is a wait even if you have an appointment. There is a long wait in between the MA taking your vitals, to see the doctor, and a long wait to get checked out. You should plan at least 2 hours when having to visit.< /review>

One star because the nurse was pleasant. The wait time is  horrible my appointment was at 5, I checked in at 4:50 was not called back until 7:06. It is now 7:31 and I am still here. WAITING. The excuse of being under staffed is not  valid whatsoever. Reschedule appointments. You guys have wasted my time and that is the worst part about it, I had to leave work early use my PTO for this. Be considerate of time, if you can't give it back don't waste it. I will be bring this to the city's attention.< /text>

<Review>Terrible service from Melina C. one of the meanest ladies in the front of the entrance . She just was so rude at the fact I had my 1 year old daughter with me and nobody told me that I couldn't bring her in with me to take the TB test .... Then I made a complaint to the head one over in the Mission Valley location, they ended up talking to Melissa and fixing it for me. I hope I never have to return to that place and Especially see her ! I could't believe she told me to leave after driving from Ramona to Kearny Mesa .<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I've been here twice and I haven't stayed longer than 1 hour. Keep in mind I've gone after 11pm though. They're quick and have helped me both times. The nurse assistants and the doctor(or nurse) are very nice. I only gave it 4 stars because the last time (last night) I went the receptionist was rude and not at all friendly. I greeted her with a smile and she was just looking at me like she hated her job. She needs to learn to smile.</review>< Pictures>

<username>Maria Magallon<//username><Review>Wow! This place is horrible. They love to waste your time. My initial visit went smoothly. Went in around 8 PM and process was fast. I've had several physical therapy sessions as well as weekly doctor checkups for about a month now. PT side is great. They keep their appointments and treat you with respect. The doctor checkups, on the other hand, are terrible. I've showed up to my appointments on time and had to wait for at least an hour to be taken in to a private room and then sit there for another hour. Last time I was there I had to walk away after 2 hours of waiting. Their excuse is that they are understaffed. Not my fault. If a doctor or nurse calls in sick you need to cancel appointments or get more help. Don't go to this place unless you have to!!!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I went to Concentra bc I had been having sharp pain in  both ears and after waiting for almost 2 hrs, the doctor finally saw me and then diagnosed me with a double bilateral ear infection and prescribed me antibiotics. I took the first dose around 9pm and then I woke up at 2am and started vomiting. This persisted all day long. When my parents got home and I had still continued to throw up, they took me to the ER. I explained to them what was going on and they checked my ears and said I didn’t have any ear infection at all. I took the antibiotics that I didnt need, so my body was trying to get rid of it, hence why I was constantly vomiting. Will never go again lol</review>

<text>Unorganized, making an appointment means nothing.  Poor management.  The staff lost the form from my employer... then kept asking for it to realize they had it. I was there for a physical and an MMR titer, the MA walked in to give me the vaccine. Im currently waiting to be seen for a physical, its been 3 hours.</text>< Pics>

I guess it must be easy to take the TIME out of your busy day to write a NEGATIVE review, but not a GOOD one. So I'm here to make a difference and writing a GREAT review for this Urgent Care facility... Because I happen to have the day off today (and have the time) because I'm INJURED. :-)
So yesterday at about 5:30PM I stabbed myself in the right foot with a pitchfork. Yes, in San Diego! :-) (We use pitchforks to go clam-digging at Silver Strand on the weekend and I was taking them out of my trunk and one slipped and almost went right through my foot to the bottom-ugh).
It was a small puncture, but really deep... and it wouldn't stop bleeding. At about 8 PM (as I'm still bleeding out), a girlfriend of mine insisted on taking me to Urgent Care. I found this place on my phone... and I'm sooooo grateful I did.
I called in to see if I could get an appointment and the lady who answered was very polite and said they only take "walk-ins" and there was about an hour wait time. So in we went, signed in, did the paperwork and waited for about an hour just as she said (She also said, "Hey, You're the girl with the pitchfork!" when we arrived :-).
The nurse who took us in the back was AMAZING.
She had an incredible bedside manner, was intelligent, kind, extremely knowledgeable, gentle, informative and witty. Her name was Mary Francis and she was VERY passionate about her profession and her love of caring for people was overwhelmingly obvious. I'm mostly writing this review for her because we need more people like Mary Francis in this world and US HealthWorks should be proud and honored to have her on staff.
Immediately after Mary Francis was done taking my vitals, gently cleaning up my wound and getting me positioned properly for the doctor, Dr. Jennifer White came in. (No waiting) She was a pretty and young doctor, who like most- was serious, professional and calculating. She examined my foot, explained my options and procedures to me, and proceeded to seal my wound with medical glue (as opposed to stitches as she suggested). She then told me about the future care of my foot and what to expect. (She told me that I should stay off of it for a couple days, keep it elevated and dry)... and then told me that someone would be in soon to administer a tetanus shot.
Shortly after she left (maybe 2 minutes later) a young guy came in, gave me a tetanus shot (quick and painless) and I was in home and in bed by 9:45PM.
I can't say enough GOOD things about my experience last night at this Urgent Care Clinic; It was very clean, updated, friendly, inviting, professionally staffed, wait time was "normal" and the staff were extremely professional, efficient, kind, caring, knowledgeable, experienced and fast working. I was in at 8:00PM and out by 9:30PM.
It was a VERY POSITIVE experience, and if I could give US HealthWorks more than 5 stars I would- because they deserve it.< /text>

My experience was okay. The reason I am giving Concentra 4 stars is that I felt that there wasn’t enough doctors going back and forth with the patients and I felt that when coming down with physical paperwork for work you should double check for everything you done<//review>

I went in tonight on New Year's Day due to having a random outbreak of hives.  This was my first time visiting this place and I was a little worried I would be there all night due to the reviews.  However, I was in and out in 50 minutes.  The gentleman at the front desk was super nice.  The PA and physician I saw were both really nice and prompt.  I was given a shot and s prescription.  I have had terrible experiences waiting extremely long times at urgent cares, so I was expecting to wait really long especially with it being New Year's Day.  I am grateful that was not the case here.</text>

I was really shocked when I came in for my D.O.T physical to see that there wasnt much of a wait before my testing. Usually its hours that I would spend my time there. Great job on whatever your doing to process people through. After dealing with these people at Concentra for the past 10 months on workman comp, OMG, I found out they used to be U.S. Health works, OMG, close your doors already. The early part of my statement was shortly after there name change, didn't know this happened, now that I do, PLEASE, HELP them!!!!!!</text>

< Review>
I had a serious reaction while working at Job employer sent me to this location at night. overall i had the worse experience ever with them. the doctor was standing 3 meters far from she was shaking while talking, i thought she is ready to fight. provided me with uncompleted information. unfortunately i had go there for the next for follow up appointment again it was the same asian doc whom saw me. the overall point of doc was that this in not work related. my concern was how to treat this how could this be fixed have no problem to pay from my own insurance. was very disappointed at this location will never visit them again.
Note: I have to say that the nurse had good behavior.</Review>

I pity you if you get badly injured at work and end up here. It is a terrible place.  Both downstairs and up in the "specialist" area. There is no Dr. In the clinic, just a PA. If you go upstairs to see a orthopedist, with an appointment,  don't expect to be seen for more than an hour after your appointment and then be seen for maybe 2 minutes.</Review>

This place is very clean and nice looking. It is the customer service, and specifically Dr. Juvy Escalante, that left a lot to be desired. I'm not sure if maybe I caught her on a bad day, or at the end of a 12hr shift, but she seemed angry/annoyed by my existence before she even walked in. Our interaction was very brief, and when she left she didnt say anything, so I thought she was coming back. I wanted to mention that I had had a sinus infection a few months prior, but was told that it was viral. I wanted to tell her that the nurse who I saw for that visit had mentioned the my ear looked "dull". I wanted to know if maybe i could be having recurring problems, what I could do about it, or if it was nothing to worry about. Basically, I had questions for the medical professional who I paid to visit, and she was very annoyed by me wanting her time with even one question. After she left abruptly, someone came in to hand me my prescriptions. I asked if she was still available (i was the only patient there, unless there were in-patients), and she reluctantly popped her head into the cracked door opening. I still only got a couple of my questions answered before she said something to the effect of "I gave you a prescription of antibiotics already". Like leave me alone, I gave you the drugs. I'm sorry if you had a bad day Juvy, but it seems to me like you hate interacting with patients. I didnt choose your career path, and you must of known that being a medical professional would involve some level of customer service. Im sorry if someone broke you, if you've lost any feelings of compassion for the people you're treating. Dont fall into the trap of treating patients like symptoms rather than humans. I know that our healthcare system is horribly flawed and that your job is difficult, but if you need to, go take some time off to relax and reevaluate. Maybe talk to a professional about your dissatisfaction with your life/job,  the hypochondriacs and people who are inexplicably angry, that lack of a life outside of work...In case you have trouble reading social cues and have no idea what I'm talking about, you came across as very rude and annoyed by me. You made me feel yet again like I am going to die at some point just because the doctors that I'm seeing dont want to listen to what I have to say, even tho I'm the one who has lived in this body for the last 30 years and have far more research hours put in than anyone possibly could. I couldnt even ask you something simple, like if it's ok to drink caffeine while recovering from an infection. I gave this place 2 stars because it is a decently nice facility and I got the prescriptions that I needed, but i may have been misdiagnosed and was treated poorly. At the least the girl who took my blood pressure and did the other preliminary stuff was kind. Juvy - feel better, do better, be better<//text>

Absolutely ridiculous, I had an appointment for a simple physical at 930 am.  The time right now is 1215 and all that they've after waiting in the waiting room for over two hours is take my vitals.  I've been sitting in my exam room for over 40 minutes now and haven't even seen a doctor yet.  A simple process that should have been rather quick has destroyed my day, and I still have no idea when I'll finally see a doctor.  I've been assured that the doctor will be in in about 5 minutes numerous times and am completely fed up.  If I didn't require this contracted physical for my employment I would have caused a scene and left a long time ago.  Absolutely ridiculous!

<text>I was treated very disrespectfuly by the X ray technician who’s name was Susan I believe, she is in her 50s and has blonde hair and wears glasses and I was told she’s been working there for about 20 years.
This emotionless person came into my room and saw that I wasn’t wearing socks because I had just changed out of examination shorts as instructed by the doctor. She looked at me and told me I need socks to continue and I explained to her that I was there to address a back injury and that I had been having a difficult time putting on my socks. She continued to stare at me and repeated that I had to put my socks on. Again, I tried to explain that I couldn’t get down that far to put my socks on to which she replied “well it’s time to get your socks on” with a blank and careless stare. I asked if maybe there was a different x ray tech who could help me and she replied, nope you’re stuck with me, put your socks on. And I said ok well as I’ve explained to you, I need help. She then questioned me as if I was lying and said “well how did you get them on before?” And I explained my girlfriend had helped me. So after about 5 minutes of this she bent down and picked my sock up and the second she touched my foot, she says “ew! There’s sweat on your foot!” And refuses to help me and calls for someone else to put my socks on.
I then asked again if there was any way I could have a different x ray tech because she was being very rude and she ignored me.
She pointed me down a hall and said that’s her room and she walked to it ahead of me while I hobbled to her with my cane.
Once in the room I asked her if x ray techs have to undergo sensitivity training and she turned around and snapped at me and said “that’s enough!” To which I replied “excuse me? After you have been this rude to me, and now I don’t even have the right to stand up for myself or to be offended by you?” And she said you have the right to be offended (admitting that she was being offensive) but you don’t have the right to barrade me.” And I said barrade you? You are the one who’s been bullying me this entire time!” And I informed her I would be notifying her superiors. And she said nothing until her “service” was over and the very last thing she did was give an incredibly insincere apology that I did not accept probably in the hopes that I would not tell anybody. Unbelievably unprofessional.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>The wait time is entirely too long.  I had an appointment at 9am for a basic physical for work. I'm currently still waiting and it's 11am. I could have set up an appointment with my pcp and gotten in and out faster. This is absolutely ridiculous.  I want to just walk out but I've already waited two hours. Hopefully they will call me back soon. I guarantee I will never come back here again.< /text>< Pics>

This is only getting 1 star as the people working there are pleasant and the doctor I saw was professional and attentive.  However, I was given a 4pm appointment yesterday for a recheck on a workman's comp injury to my right shoulder.  I arrived at 3:55pm, was checked in, and sat to wait...and wait,,,,and wait.  I got up and checked to see how much longer at about 5:30, and was told I was up soon, even though I had an appointment.   I was finally led into an exam room at 6:03,  and again I waited and waited.   I finally poked my head out to check to make sure I was not forgotten, and also to use the restroom.  I was told that I was going to be seen very soon,....wrong again!    The doctor came in at 7:40!!!  For a 4pm apppointment???  I vented my frustrations and he proceeded to follow up with me on my injury.  This took just under 15 minutes!!  Needless to say I was not a happy camper......especially since I was NOT a new patient that needed an evaluation!   What was the purpose of giving me an Appointment if I had to just wait in the order that we all checked in?  I talked to a woman sitting next to me who had NO appointment and she was seen before me for a new workman's comp injury!   So we will see how it goes next week as I have another followup appointment at 5:30pm.....I will give it an hour and if I am not seen, will stop using this facility and go to another one, even though they close at 5pm.  At least I know that I won't be waiting for over 3 hours!!!   Totally unacceptable and very disappointed with this clinic!!<//review>

The lady at the front desk was very rude and unwelcoming . She truly has no business being the first face you see as you enter the business . The male who came in after here . Compensatied for her rudeness. He was warm , friendly , professional and kind . The stars are for him . He saved the day .<//review>

<Text>My 9:00 appt. Started after 10:00 , and only after I asserted myself. I was then moved to a segregation room and forgot about for 30 or so minutes until I then again complained. Total mess. I was told to get undressed by a tech. Later the doctor came in and asked why I was undressed. Go anywhere but US Healthworks off if Ruffin Road unless you have a day to piss away. Bring a book to read and appointments mean nothing.</Text>< Pics>

Staff are friendly but unfortunately unprofessional and need a Training on presentation. Also, when they are on the phone you can here patients social security and personal information given out. Lastly, the office need a major remodel it looks run down.< /review>

< review>
I wished i would have looked at reviews earlier.   I would have gone somewhere else.  I do want to note that the gentlemen with the glasses that took my xrays was awesome.  Extremely courteous, professional and even funny.  I appreciate your services, sir.  Now on to the horrible part...

Came in with a broken wrist.  Me and my girlfriend both agreed that my wrist looked pretty bad (she said it looked deformed) but when i showed the doctor lady, she said it looked fine???   Once she saw the xray though, she said 'its broken' and although i clearly stated i was in a lot of pain, she gave me aleve and told me to figure it out with a specialist.  ALEVE...she gave me aleve for a broken wrist.  Additionally, she did not give me a full report of her initial diagnosis.  Only care instructions.  Every other time i've gone to an urgent care i have gotten a diagnosis report. I feel that from a legal standpoint, its probably best to follow proper procedure when diagnosing patients...

Anyhow, I asked her if the prescription was in the paper she gave me, since i didn't see it.  She said 'yes' and hurried away.  Once I got home I reviewed my papers again and guess what...she forgot my prescription so i had to call, ask for it, then go all the way back there to get it.  So, in addition to only getting aleve, i had to wait an additional hour after i left from my visit to get my pain prescription.  Dont mind the pain, he can deal with it...

Additionally, the lady at reception was pretty unprofessional and clearly couldn't multitask.  She was trying to take lunch but was complaining that someone needed to cover her because she still had '3 "things" to check in'.  You know we can hear you, right?

I noticed that a lot of the people coming in were people that had to come in there because that was the only option their work gave them.  My instinct tells me that they treat patients kind of bad because of this presumption that the demographic there is less educated.  That's the vibe i got.  Or maybe I'm wrong and its the companies unreasonable expectations, namely unreasonable work loads, coupled with high performance expectations and lack of proportional pay.  They did mention they were understaffed.

I feel sorry for those patients that don't have any other option but to go there.  America's healthcare system is messed up and its because of companies like yours.  Definitely never going back there again.  10/10 would have this place demolished to build a cat cafe in its place.<//review>

I went to this clinic with very low expectations, and had a great experience. They were quick to process me, the doctor was thorough, kind, and attentive, and they even gave me a follow-up call today to see if I had any questions with my medication.< /Text>

Picked this location to do a pre-employment drug screen, since it was a big center and on my way home. I performed the necessary ‘duties’ and my expectant future employer never received the results. Over a week later, my job was contingent on receiving an ok result, I had to visit a different healthcare company to re-screen. Employer received results in less than a half hour. And I have a job.</Review>

Waited 3 hours to be seen by a doctor. I got a call 2 days later telling me that they did the test incorrectly and do not have any results. Avoid this incompetent facility at all costs. If i could give them a worse review than 1 star they would get it.</Review>

After sittings here for 4 hours.  I hate this place tons of employees but no one doing anything. one provider that seem to be on slow mode. After three hours in the waiting room. They called my name put me in a medical room. 1 more hour  and the entire staff has told me  from the beginning  you are next in line. I've watched 11people get seeing and released since ive been here. they all got here after me. This place has no organization and obviously from a business stands point can't handlle the work load. I recommended to everyone to just go to the ER it easier.</review>

EXTREMELY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE! Around 2 AM my girlfriend had a very severe migraine, without wanting to go to the hospital we decided to go to the only 24 hour urgent care in the area. BIG MISTAKE. I first called in to ensure that her insurance was accepted there, I was told it was. Upon arrival we were given paperwork and told to wait. After barely being able to fill out I had mentioned my girlfriend was in excruciating pain simply to be told by the nurse " I know what she's going through I get migraines all the time " ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! When all said and done, after 15 minutes of nothing we were told they her insurance was not accepted, and we needed to take ourselves elsewhere . As if this couldn't have been established initially over the telephone or the first thing upon arrival.

Extremely unprofessional,rude, and overall a horrible customer service experience. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone !!!!!!!</Text>

So... I needed to go to urgent care due to a work related injury. I found that this location was the only one in San Diego that was 24/7 which wasn't too inconvenient, as San Diego isn't so big. As a "walk-in" I arrived about 10:45am and there were maybe 2 other people waiting to be seen. Football was on so that was a plus. I filled out the paper work and 10 minutes after I was in an exam room waiting for the Doc. The Doc was thorough and informative (as should be). The longest wait was after the exam waiting on paperwork but I was out of there by about 12:15pm. Granted this was a Sunday so perhaps I just got lucky on timing but to have everything completed within 1hr 30mins seems very acceptable. The staff seemed nice enough and the facility was clean (also, as it should be). I just  wish I had the doctors "cutejulez" (below) had! Would give 5 stars but am still awaiting follow up for ultrasound 3 days later.<//review>

I had a hand injury at work and my company sent me to us health works on Ruffin Road in San Diego. I was there for approximately 5 and a 1/2 hours. I saw physician's assistant, occupational therapist and received a drug screen. Today I had an appointment at 5:15 p.m. and was not seen until 630. They are understaffed.</Text>

< Review>
I went for a normal drug test for employment. The staff is worse than DMV, rude as if they are catching a drug dealer.

Staff need behavior training, they don't bother explaining or answering any questions. The guy who answers the phone and the girl who took the urine test were both unprofessional.

If I have to take a drug test again in future for employment, I will not choose to go to examOne.< /Review>

This place is the worse place ever to go to. You walk in, there's no line in the waiting line and the staffs behind the desk just looks at you all dumb and don't even acknowledge you. Can't even give a greeting. I took my paperwork back and left to a different US HealthWorks.</review>

The staff at the front desk were extremely rude. Didn’t have a care in the world of accommodating me when I went in there for a knee injury. I could not bed my knee and they didn’t offer an option of something that can lend me assistance. I could not sit, so I stood leaning on a wall in a corner crying in pain. There were people there for acupuncture more than anything. The best staff was the actual doctor. My X-ray tech was all over the place. First she wanted to do my X-ray but there was already someone waiting for one to be done. The doctor stopped her after she told me to get up for my X-ray. Then a little tiff between for Cote and tech; I told the tech I can wait and to take the other patient first. Then after the X-ray  she told me to walk with the cane incorrectly. I had my injury on my right knee; she told me to bring the cane forward when I brought my left leg forward... please tell me how that makes any sense?!?

I will not be returning to this office as my overall experience was horrible.<//review>

Waited for 2 hours to get seen for 5 minutes and have some clueless "physician" randomly guess what was wrong, citing symptoms that were visibly absent, and prescribe me medicine with no care information. Everyone I encountered seemed particularly clueless. Then they sent me the bill instead of filing through the insurance which I provided.</review>

Soooo slow! All the workers stand around talking about lunch and junk but never actually work. Even with an appointment you'll wait at least 30 minutes to be seen. The only reason I'm here is because of a work related injury and this was the required place.< /text>

The two guys working the check in counter at 3pm today 3/22 are super rude and sarcastic.
Not the first time I've been here for random drug tests for work. These two guys are always rude to everyone.

Worst possible service. Came in WITH APPOINTMENT, and got asked to the back 1.5 hours after appt time. Then waited another half hour to be seen. Negative stars.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I should have chosen Sharp. Waiting time and English are ... Indian Indian doctor and Korean apprentice nurse. X-ray engineers are skilled, but machines are like that. I was worried about cracks, but I was told it was safe. No, it ’s four hours after all. Received amazing treatment. I don't want to go anymore !!!!

I should have chosen Sharp.  待ち時間と英語が、、、印度人系医師と韓国系見習いナース君。レントゲン技師は熟練者だが、機械もそんな感じ。ひび割れが気になったが、安全と言われたんで、そうなんだろう。いやぁ、結局四時間。驚くべき扱いを受けた。もう絶対行きたくない!!!!</text>< pics>
