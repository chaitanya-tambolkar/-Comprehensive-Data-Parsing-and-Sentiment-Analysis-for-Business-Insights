# Comprehensive-Data-Parsing-and-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Business-Insights

This project focused on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis, uncovering insights such as the impact of COVID-19 on customer reviews to support structured business decision-making.Applied NLP (VADER) on 10K+ Google reviews to analyse sentiment and assess COVID-19’s impact. Built a Python pipeline improving efficiency by 30%, parsed semi-structured TXT/Excel data, and generated CSV/JSON outputs to extract key metrics for business insights.

Key Achievements:
• Parsing Raw Files: Collaborated on developing an end-to-end data pipeline using Python, improving processing efficiency by 30%. The system parsed semi-structured Google Reviews data across 15 TXT files with corresponding Excel metadata.
• Metrics Extraction: Delivered well-structured CSV and JSON outputs for over 10,000 reviews, extracting vital metrics such as review counts, response rates, and sentiment polarity for downstream analysis and visualization.
• NLP Implementation: Utilised the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) model to analyse sentiment trends across customer feedback, identifying key behavioral shifts influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and enabling data-driven strategic recommendations.
