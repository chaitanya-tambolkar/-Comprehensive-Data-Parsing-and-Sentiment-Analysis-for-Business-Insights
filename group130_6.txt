I went to this store today at 5:30 pm and the manager doesn't want to help me. I ask her if she can take the dress from the manikin because I need to exchange the dress I bought to a smaller size but she doesn't want to do it. Very unhelpful< /Text>

< Review>
It's okay, I felt the selection was a bit low and I swear I spent 10 minutes walking around the day we were in there looking for someone to help. If I'm paying mall prices, I expect a great selection and inventory and good customer service.  But it's becoming increasingly cheaper and easier to shop online for clothes these days.</Review>

I love H&M. They have great deals for the quality of their clothes.  Some prices are a little up there for some of their blouses,  but not too bad.< /review>

<Review>My dad and I just bought his bike from here! Inside the store is a bit dark coz of the bordered windows. They have alot of bikes to choose from. Cristian, who assisted us is very good and the bike technician and manager as well! They are accommodating! The bike we bought so far is holding up to it's brand (Specialized). All in all a good place to find good bikes!</Review>< pics>

The overall experience of shopping for a bike was very comfortable. The staff is very knowledgeable and extremely patient with answering questions and providing a lot of test rides. There are 3 floors of bikes in the shop and the offerings are an abundance of bike choices ranging between different kinds, colors and sizes. They were also extremely generous to swap out the bike seat and pedals to my liking. Additionally, they offered plenty of helpful tips so that I could choose the perfect bike for me. If you‚Äôre for affordable bikes and kind service. This is the spot to go to!< /text>

There is a large selection of used bikes in excellent condition. I bought a used bike and left my old bike with them to consign. Within a week they had sold it at a higher price than I even expected.

<Review>These guys did a great job with setting up my new bike. It was shipped to them from the folks at Brooklyn Bicycle Co. They got this riding nicer than any bike I‚Äôve owned before and the setup fees were very reasonable.

They also helped me about a week after I left the shop when I got new grips. Same day, helped me swap the two out since I didn‚Äôt have solution to get the old ones free.

Great people!<//Review><rating>5< /rating><response>None<//response>< Pics>

Asked for a full check up. Many things were overlooked. Thankfully, a staff member fixed a few things as I was picking up my bike.
It'd have been more efficient for me to do it myself or go somewhere else.< /review>

Had a nasty dropped chain on my bike, and I made things worse and screwed up my derailleur trying to fix it myself. Brought it in to Columbus Cyclery and they were able to sort me out quickly and for far less than i thought it was going to cost me!  Couldn't reccomend these guys more. If you need repairs, this is the spot.< /Review>

Love this place! The people that work there are so nice. I've bought two bikes from them, first a hybrid a few years ago and a few months back a road bike. They work great. I recently had a fundraiser for Homegrown Hustle and they donated two certificates for a bike and tune up to support our cause. Thank you, Columbus Cyclery!<//Text>

< Review>
just bought a bike here :D i walked in with about medium knowledge for what i wanted in a bike (using my last bike, which i loved, as the model for what i wanted), and trusted a friend and the team here to help me figure out the rest. the team was super knowledgable and gave a lot of information about how different bikes would or would not work for me. what i enjoyed the most was that Bruno (the owner, i think) wanted to get me the best bike, and didn't try to "sell" me a bike. even when i would get awestruck by the beauty of a bike, he would advise me on why that bike didn't fit my other preferences. they also let you test ride the bikes, and will adjust the height of the bike so that you can really feel what it would be like riding it. definitely would recommend this shop to a friend!<//Review>

"A few weeks ago I bought a Pure single Speed bike at this shop with a U-lock.  The bike has been great and I enjoy it.  Today, someone tried to steal the handlebar I guess, since the front part of the stem was gone...  Fortunately, the handlebar was still there hanging by the brake cable.  I went to the shop after the incident, and in about 20 minutes, they replaced the stem with another one.  They would not take any money from me, and also readjusted the seat position to a better liking.  Anyway, a bad situation that got resolved quickly and at no cost to me at the end of the day.  Thank you Columbus Cyclery!"<//Review>

Great Experience.¬† I bought a Kona mountain bike there earlier this year and it worked out perfect for me. Plenty of bikes to look at and try.¬† 3 store levels !

I also got my u-lock, lights and helmets on the spot at a discount.¬† ¬†Then I had to move to Hawaii¬† for a new job and decided to take my bike along.¬† I went back to Columbus Cyclery and in 24 hours, they had my bike disassembled and neatly packed in a box.¬† I flew with it as extra luggage, put it back together, and I now enjoy riding it in Hawaii.¬† Very good experience for me.< /Review>

I completely regret going to this bike shop. I bought a $400 used bike one week ago and after riding it for four days, the seat kept falling down and I had to tighten the clamp every night. The chain popped off three times. I stopped riding it because it was just a headache. I went back to return the bike only to find out it‚Äôs a 30 day warranty, there is not return policy except the 18 month buy back. Which was vaguely explained when we bought the bike and the policy is only listed on the website not on an any of the paperwork I signed. When I brought the bike back, the guy over tightened the seat clamp and I couldn‚Äôt adjust it to ride out of the store. He said he couldn‚Äôt recreate the chain popping off and sent me on my way, telling me it‚Äôs a good bike and everything is fine. I requested that the bike be serviced, as is a part of this 30 day warranty, and they kept saying everything was fine and not believing the issues I was explaining to them. I‚Äôll accept responsibility for not asking the right questions about the return policy but at the end of the day these guys sold me a bad bike and won‚Äôt take responsibility for it.<//Review>

The french guy that runs this place is incredibly rude. I was biking home when my chain broke. I looked for the closest place and found this one. The problem was, I didn't have my wallet. I explained to the tech there and asked him if I could get my wife to call in and have her give them my credit card number. He said they couldn't do that. I asked if I could pay tomorrow, but that i needed my bike to go home. He said they would call me when it was done, in about 20 minutes, and i could pay tomorrow.  He took my number and I told him i was going to walk around the block. He called me and i came right in, but he said I couldn't have my bike until i paid. I thought he was going to let me pay tomorrow, and he said he thought i was going to get the money from 'someone outside', which doesn't really make sense. Then he said i should talk to the owner. I explained, and the owner simply said, 'you need to go get money.' No 'sorry for the confusion', or 'I'm really sorry but...' I asked if they took venmo, and they said No. But, a really nice guy working there said i could venmo him and he would pay. (I gave him a good tip). Then, right before I left, to let the owner know that there were no hard feelings, i asked the owner if he was from Lyon (there was a sign up), he didn't even look up from what he was reading, he just said, yes. This guy was the personification of rude. If he were acting in a movie and trying to play a misanthropic sociopath, the director would have told this guy he was overacting.< /Review>

Found them through Craigslist Ad and called in to check what bikes they had in stock.  Had a great experience with the owner and staff.  Was able to find a deeply discounted set of bikes that were hardly used.  I recommend you check them out!</review>

Fantastic must do guided cycle trip across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito, TIP book your return by ferry in advance at info kiosk to avoid the massive bike queue for the ferry. Thank you Richard you were great guide, bikes were all in good condition and efficiently organised.<//Review>

<Review>Excellent customer service. I went in to rent a road bike and was helped immediately. I had a nalgene water bottle with me which didn't fit the water bottle holders on the bike, so one of the associates found an alternative holder that fit and installed it in seconds, free of charge. They also let me leave my backpack in the store while I was out. Upon returning the rental, I was again assisted immediately, and charged for 2 hours, though I'm fairly certain I had the bike for at least 3. Awesome store, would highly recommend!</Review>< pics>

Remember that in general the Alcatraz ones are not sold ‚Äúon their own‚Äù. They are mostly available as part of a Tour pack (with a bus tour, cycle rental, etc.). If you go to Pier 33 to buy a couple of them expect to be told that the next available ticket/departure will be in 2 months‚Äô time, no kidding. Same can happen if you book on line, you need to book them months in advance. However I discovered this low key bike shop in 801 Columbus Avenue, ‚ÄúColumbus Cyclery Go Bike It‚Äù and guess what... they have Alcatraz tickets available with a waiting list of only 3-5 days (better than waiting 60) combined with their bike rental, of course. The ticket includes the ferry to and from Alcatraz as well as the super interesting audio guide + bike rental too. Enjoy the ride!!!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

They spam craigslist with decently priced used bikes, but when you visit them in store, none of them are there. Instead, they try to push you towards overpriced used bikes. Was told a bike was a steal even though I could have paid 10% more to get the bike new.< /text>

< review>
Came here looking for a bike this weekend due to all the rave reviews. The sales guy that we had (don't remember the name) seemed barely awake and not very communicative. I told him the bike size I was generally interested in and although we said we weren't interested in a particular bike and were more interested in another bike, he had me go ride it anyway (communication issues I think). At any rate, he didn't seem really eager to help and I wasn't really impressed with any of the bikes. I honestly didn't think the prices were that great either - $350-500 for most of the very vintage road bikes we looked at.

I left generally unimpressed.< /review>

Great service, and a nice selection of second hand bikes for a very reasonable price. Also they have a policy of buying back the bikes for half what you gave, which is very useful for short-term visitors.<//Text>

<Text>I traded in a week old $99 bike for a bike in well-used condition which costs $450 new, ( I found out later), and I paid nearly $300. They replaced a cracked tire before I left the shop, thanks fellas, but when I drew attention to a worn- out chain they said it was ok. Another shop later showed me the chain wear was outside the scope of their measuring tool. These guys are ok..but they took advantage of my ignorance. I shouldn't have trusted the fairness of the price I paid. My bad. Just hurting a little.</Text>< resp>

< Review>
Just have terrible experience dealing with this establishment. I came there to tune up my bike (using Groupon), install new chain and fix wobbly rear wheel. They forced me to install new cassette and tried to push me to install new 29 rear wheel instead of 32 I have. So I would be riding on a bike with 32 front wheel and 29 rear!!!!

They have blown up one of the tubes and made me pay for the new one! Why did they touch my tube and tried to inflate completely inflated tube?!!!! Why should I pay for their incompetence?!!!!

By phone, they were saying that I will be paying $70 but when I showed up in the place the real price appeared to be more than $100. When I asked why such difference they said that the bike is old!  Was it new by phone and suddenly became old when I came to pick it up?!!

Then I cycled home and suddenly found out that  I cannot change speed on the just tuned bike!!! What did I just paid for?!

Extremely unprofessional. I'll never let them touch my bike again!< /Review>

<user_name>Klara Balogh< /user_name><text>I bought my bike here 5months ago and today we bought one for my husband. They are very friendly and have a good selection of decent used and new bikes too even if you are on a budget. No point to bother with Craigslist, you can be sure u buy legit here and they also offer guarantee even for their used bikes!I've recieved good customer service on both visit and not pushy sales. Can highly reccomend it!< /text>< pics>

<text>If you looking to rent a bike and do Alcatraz this is the place to book your tickets!!!! $99pp for a bike rental and Alcatraz. The staff is really freindly. Bike tour starts at 10am ( you do this with in 72 hours of the Alcatraz tour) and the staff guide you on a 8mile ride over the Golden Gate Bridge you then head back on the ferry to Fishermans Whalf but get to keep the bike till 8pm. Then you do the Alcatraz tour on whatever day they booked for you which includes the ferry to and from and the audio tour. Highly recomend this I couldnt get tickets for Alcatraz I left it to the last minute but these guys had avail tickets as I was booking for 4. Our guide for the bike tour was Alec he was really good!!< /text><username>Ravjit Dulay<//username>< Response>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Good family experience. Interesting price and quality bikes.
Small flat the baby trailer had a faulty closure. It was therefore necessary to cover it.
I recommend

Bonne exp√©rience familiale.  Prix int√©ressant et v√©los de qualit√©s.
Petit b√©mol la remorque b√©b√© avait une fermeture d√©fectueuse. Il fallait donc bien le couvrir.

I trained with ADOLFO at Hit Fit Nob Hill when I was in San Francisco on a business trip.  He's such an amazing trainer, that later in the year, I flew back just to train with him for a week.  I plan to do the same several times this year.  Anyone looking to train and learn how to box, for whatever reason, will not go wrong working with this guy!  Would recommend him to anyone!<//Review>

This gym was the best experience I‚Äôve had with a boxing gym, due primarily to coach Troy. Troy took me from a casual boxing fan to a real boxing fan. His teaching style is very effective and engaging. Great balance of boxing and fitness. I think i signed up for a membership after one class. I have and would recommend his class to anyone considering taking up boxing or looking to hone in their current abilities.

The gym itself is also set up really nicely, and the front desk staff was always helpful and friendly.</Review>

I love HIT Fit! Angela is absolutely AMAZING. She is an incredible instructor. I love her positive energy and her creative workouts . Her classes are always fun, challenging and never repetitive. I look forward to her classes every week, they are the perfect way to help me destress and unwind. Would highly recommend everyone to take her class. Definitely wont regret it :)<//text>

Love being there‚Äîgreat trainers and staff; good-feel, communal atmosphere. I have been training with Xavier McKay for 10 years.  I started at the suggestion of the physical therapist prescribed for my herniated disk. After months of training with Xavier, I avoided back surgery, and regained flexibility and core strength.  In order to stave off boredom, Xavier incorporated more boxing moves and technique into my workouts.  I ultimately got hooked on boxing.  The cardio and circulation benefits of the intense training has been miraculous with counter-intuitively low-impact on my house-of-cards skeletal structure.

I currently train 3 days per week with Xavier and another outstanding HIT Fit trainer, Edge Brown.  In addition, I have been showing up to the informal Sunday morning sparring queue. I spar with, and learn from, some of the nicest, most fun, diverse group of people I have ever been around.  All involved, while competitive and passionate about boxing, are safety conscious, and mindful of skill differences.  Five stars doesn't really do HIT Fit justice.< /review>< Pictures>

This gym has really made living in San Francisco feel like home. The facility is nice and well maintained, especially the bathrooms. Each and everyone of the trainers are well trained boxers and skilled coaches. My personal favorite class to take is Leo‚Äôs advanced class. He really knows his technique and is truly one of the best humans I‚Äôve met here in SF.

Love my gym!</review>

The first time I walked into this gym, it was a great experience. The girl behind the counter was very nice. The gym looked awesome. Plenty of mirrors to see yourself work. Plenty of punching bags. The one thing I noticed is that is was very clean! If you want to train with a personal trainer for a variety of martial arts or if you want to take a class that will teach you the correct technique for boxing. Ask for Leo Larsen. One of the best trainers in the gym!! He is nice and very professional and will listen to your needs.</text>

I train primarily with Troy King and have had great results! He pushes you hard while being a great motivator and can find your skills and hone them in. If your goal is weight loss and just overall fitness he has great workouts and nutritional advice as well. I've leaned out and lost 10lbs since I started working out under Troy and couldn't be happier with the results. Do yourself a favor and glove up and get to work at Hit Fit SF with Troy King!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

My favorite part about Hit Fit is that they have such strong team of trainers! I usually go for Angela's classes, she is incredible and has such energy. Don't get fooled by her petite look, she will make you sweat! She teaches multiple classes and one-on-one's, I tried all of them, they are so good. She changes the program and tries to bring to it something new all the time, so you can never get bored!<//Text>

Seriously awesome gym! I mostly work out with Troy here doing individual/small group boxing sessions - I leave feeling exhausted but awesome and invigorated at the same time. I've made a lot of progress since starting to work with Troy (other gyms/places I box have even commented) and would highly recommend these sessions! I've also taken a few boxing classes at both locations and they are great as well, some of my favorite in the city.</Review>

I‚Äôve been working at HIT Fit for about 4 years and it is an amazing gym. The staff, coaches and trainers are all highly skilled in what they do and the passion they have for fitness truly shows in their work. The gym itself is extremely clean, they offer towel service, the bathrooms and showers are fully equipped with shampoo, soap, towels and many other products which is so useful should you ever forget something. I highly recommend this gym to all my friends and family!</Text>

Hit Fit SF is one of my favorite gyms to work out in, there committed to getting you in the best shape of your life! They have many different classes and you can have your own personal trainer which I opted for and have trained with Cole for over a year now with great results. If your serious about getting in shape don‚Äôt look no further and everyone there treat you like family... love this place!

Hit Fit offers high intensity training for all levels. I used to attend boxing classes and now train with Leo Larson - a very skilled fighter and awesome boxing trainer. He is patient and pushes you to learn proper technique with attention to detail. He is also a boxing encyclopedia ;) I highly recommend Hit Fit and training with Leo (or you can just sign up for his boxing classes).< /review>

I've been training with Adolfo for about a year. He's helped me get in my best shape since my 20s. Totally recommend boxing, it's challenging, rewarding and way more fun than running on a treadmill. The space is clean, well equipped and has a fun vibe.</Review>

This is the best gym not only in San Francisco but in the Bay Area.  Each trainer brings their own unique style and intensity to each class.  Hit Fit‚Äôs bootcamp are really amazing and will take your fitness to a whole new level.

I would highly recommend training with Adolfo Velez to improve your boxing skills. He worked with me for several months to  improve my boxing technique and training.  Adolfo made me a stronger and better boxer.</Review>

<Review>I've been coming here for a few years now. The classes are difficult but the trainers do a great job catering to a range of skill levels and still making the classes fun. I joined because I wanted to start boxing and the classes here have been incredible. Leo Larsen's classes are my favorite because they deliberately build the core foundational skills compared to other gyms where they just exhaust you hitting a bag. Would recommend for anybody interested getting a workout thats more fun than just going to 24hr fitness or looking to start boxing.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Hit fit SF is an amazing place to workout all around. Both boxing and hiit classes are amazing. This review in particular is for Angela, I have been doing her classes for a few months and she is amazing! She always pushes you to give your max and takes time to perfect your technique during the class. I recommend both HIT FIT SF and Angela 100%!</text>

This gym is an easy 15 minute walk from the hotel on my last visit to SF which was perfect for getting a session in before starting my day. It is a huge space that is well maintained and well equipped‚Äîwith a full sized boxing ring!! The staff and trainers are also incredibly professional and knowledgeable. I will definitely be back next time I‚Äôm in the area.< /Review>

<user_name>Cole Nagy<//user_name><Rating>5< /Rating><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Hit Fit SF Nob Hill is a revamped version of Polk St. Gym, same coaches/trainers but just a new location and new look. They have a full sized boxing ring and a giant floor space for circuit training. Boxing classes are mostly taught by former fighters or high level certified coaches. The circuit training classes are 6O min of very intense HIIT and conditioning workouts. All trainers have a different style, so I recommend trying as many classes as possible to check out the wide variety of training.

Also, this gym offers a 90 minute Boxing Boot Camp from 6 AM to 7:30 AM. Where you get both Boxing and strength and conditioning. Very clean facility and overall great gym!</Review><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80858094dab29b35:0x18e53a5cdbb55172</Gmap_id><user>116447222624136510869< /user><Date>1576885814011< /Date></record>

<Text>This gym is very good. For me, it‚Äôs all about the community and the people who run it. Plenty of gyms out there that can get you fit, a few that can teach you to box, but none that offer you quite the same combination of boxing, fitness and feeling of community. This is what sets this gym apart from the rest. Hands down the best gym in San Francisco.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I started going to hit fit when they first opened about five years ago. The gym was a great fit for me as it is open ALL the time, the space is supremely clean (rare in the martial arts world), and the trainers and clientele are superb. While all of the trainers are great I quickly developed an affinity for Leo‚Äôs style and deep knowledge of the sport, it‚Äôs history, and various styles. This knowledge enables him to coach students in an individualized manner rather than pidgeon-holing you into the style in which he was steeped. I would highly recommend this gym to anyone looking to learn how to box, further there already existing experience with boxing, or train for a fight. Hit Fit is an excellent boxing gym!< /Review>

I can't say enough positive things about about Trishala's class. She always manages to pushing you to your limits and encoring you every step of they way. The best thing about her classes is that I can actually see improvements in my health and strength. When I started I was on the lower end of the weights and with time, patients, and Trish always cheering me on I've been able to get stronger and fitter. Something I have not found in any other work out class. Her programs are always fun and and keep you moving with high energy in the room. She really makes the atmosphere in the room feel welcoming and supporting. Can't wait to go back!<//Review>

Love this place since it is a very short commute from where I live.  Gym is very clean, they offer towels, love the bathrooms, and just love the vibe of this place.  My very first class is with an instructor named Angela and she is awesome! She had some really creative workouts that give you this amazing feeling after your whole body is drenched with sweat! Initially, I just got some passes on Groupon for a deal just to try it out, but after a few classes with Angela - I was convinced that I needed a membership here.  I have found the right gym for me. Thank you Hit Fit.</Review>

I've been at many gyms over the years, and HitFit Nob Hill is the friendliest, most fun, and most effective. I get a great workout, learn some boxing theory, and practice my moves at Troy King's Sunday class, with some special attention (he is very patient) Thurs evening. A good gym with good people!</Text>

Friendly staff. Clean facility. If you are thinking about taking up boxing Leo is a super knowledgeable instructor, he is pays attention to everyone one in class and is able to pass on his knowledge effectively. I always walk out of class feeling accomplished
The TRX class is equally as good. Cole will always push you become stronger, faster and better with out compromising form or risking injury.</Review>

<text>Been taking the TRX and boxing classes here since I work down the street - it's super convenient. The vibe is unpretentious and you can tell the trainers genuinely care about their attendees. They are always adjusting me or correcting me if my form is off and don't make me feel bad about it. The workouts are intense and you leave super sweaty and feeling awesome!< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Awesome place.

Extremely clean gym with enough space for every one to work out in.  This place has a lot of equipments for boxing as well TRX for the high intensity training.  Absolutely killer workouts! Angela was one of my very first instructors and let me tell you, she is one hell of a trainer and also my go to ! She will correct you if she feels that you are doing something incorrect and also give you tips on how to deal with certain workout positions. Motivation level to workout has gone up the roof with her workouts and it is something I do look forwards to towards the end of my day.  This place can't do you wrong if you gave it a shot. Clean gym, clean bathrooms, GOOD WATER, and great staffs!<//Review><rating>5<//rating><Pics>None</Pics><Date>1577775091365< /Date>< resp>

<Text>Never in my life did I think I‚Äôd like something like HitFit. The workouts make Barry‚Äôs and SoulCycle look like a nursery playground. The exercises are intense and really push you. And on top of it all I‚Äôm a runner so I‚Äôm definitely not built for this.

But the trainers are really incredible. Great coaches, lots of variety of workouts. I‚Äôve been going to Angela‚Äôs classes for months and am hooked. She‚Äôs an amazing trainer and her classes are equal parts fun and tough. I recommend hits it, especially if you think you‚Äôre the kind of person who wouldn‚Äôt like these kinda of workouts.</Text>< pics>

<Review>The trainers at Hit Fit are amazing. I attend Leo and Sean's classes as often as I can. Leo is knowledgable and takes the time to teach everyone at varying skill levels, from beginners to more advanced gym members. He stresses the fundamentals to ensure safety, as well as a solid working knowledge of how to properly throw punches. Sean's classes are challenging but definitely doable, with a heavy focus on cardio. He pushes the class, but also respects that many people are still learning and offers helpful tips for how to execute punching combos and fundamentals. Highly recommend this gym for anyone to get in shape, regardless of your skill level.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Leo's boxing classes are some of the best I've taken. He does a great job explaining the moves to us and always makes sure every one is where they're supposed to be and doing things right. I feel like I've know some of my class mates much longer than I actually have. It's always nice to see them after a long work day.</review>< user>

Friendly staff, technique first boxing trainers, extremely clean.

Covid protocols are being taken extremely seriously at this gym.  everyone who comes in is given a laser temperature check and a spray bottle and rag.  You get your own huge square to work out in and never are close to other members.  If you care about these protocols i cant give this gym a high enough rating.<//review>

I started working out at HitFit based on a friend‚Äôs recommendation and I‚Äôm so glad I did.  I can‚Äôt speak to all the trainers, but Angela‚Äôs class is motivating and challenging. She plans fun circuits- and tortures is just the right amount. I look forward to her class every week!</text>

<review>I did not have a good experience at HitFit. I was really hoping for a good boxing gym after moving here. I recommend going somewhere else. The instructor looked unhappy to be there. He was very disengaged and spoke as little to the class as possible. There were many other people in the gym while the class was going on which was distracting. Everyone at the facility seemed unenthusiastic.</review>< Pictures>

I've tried out quite a few gyms in San Francisco and this is definitely the best experience I've had! The boxing classes are approachable, fun, and very challenging. You learn a ton of technique while getting a really good workout. The TRX/HIIT classes are super challenging as well. The trainers and staff are very friendly! There's also equipment to do your own workout if you don't make it to a class. Highly recommend!<//Text>

You can expect to get a full body workout with cardio while learning the technical skills of boxing. Leo Larsen will give you great insight to understanding the moves, and Sean Hall really works you to build the base for boxing.</Review><time>1563383389007</time><user>111619991050057172193</user><gmap_id>0x80858094dab29b35:0x18e53a5cdbb55172</gmap_id><rating>5<//rating><response>{'time': 1563385464228, 'text': 'Thanks Ethan!

<Time>1578170243912</Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>Hit Fit has been a game changer for me in my fitness journey. Classes and Boot Camps are incredibly challenging and fun. I have tried many gyms, but they‚Äôre classes have kept my progress increasing session by session. Trainers and staff are friendly, tough and make it a point to know the regulars and keep us in check. I recommend any class, Trish on Tuesdays and Saturday‚Äôs really makes it worth the pain, great music and intense metcons. Cole  with great technique training in boot camps and noon classes, Wayne for spunk and speed and Jamal for amazing TRX action.

Boxing coaches each have their own unique and intense style, I mainly go to Andrew in the am and he‚Äôs always great at teaching why techniques work.

Warren and the front desk team are always a friendly face and encouragement, Laura the sweetest GM and all the personal trainers that use the space really make you want to work harder.

Thanks HIT FIT fam!< /review>< pictures>

Been to a few of the bootcamps and classes at hitfit. Had never boxed before coming here and feel like I've learned (and sweat) more here than any other spots in the city.

The team is amazing & can't recommend it enough. The realest gym in SF.< /text>

<Text>HITFIT has one of the best HIIT/TRX workouts in the city! I started off with a groupon pass and ended up loving it so much, I joined the membership. Angela‚Äôs super fun, energetic class sold me! Every class is different but get ready to work your butt off every time! It‚Äôs not easy but it feels so rewarding when you‚Äôre done. I like that she also takes the time to really help you out with proper form and works with you through any body injuries or weaknesses. I‚Äôd highly recommend her classes, you won‚Äôt regret it!</Text>< name>

<review>Hitfit SF is my favorite gym of all time. It has a little bit of everything. All the boxing trainers are really knowledgeable and passionate about the sport of boxing. Troy King, Hank Frost, Andrew Moy, Jairo Escobar, Sean Hall are some of the top notch trainers in the industry. Simon Redmond has really built a great culture within the gym and the people here have really become great friends and family.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80858094dab29b35:0x18e53a5cdbb55172< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have always loved my time at HitFit as this is the place I've called home and where I learned how to box and really started taking HIIT classes. To be specific, Trish's classes at HitFit are some of the most challenging classes and best workouts that I've taken in San Francisco! She is also an incredible instructor that not only pushes you, but is encouraging and helpful when it comes to form and modifications. Trish is incredibly dedicated to her craft, as is the entire HitFit staff! I highly recommend the gym to anyone who wants to take their fitness to the next level and kickstart their journey.<//text>< Pictures>

I no longer consider working out as a chore anymore!! Before joining this gym, my friend asked me to take a class and I was skeptical because like lets be real, who likes being yelled at? But it‚Äôs nothing like that! Angela is one of the instructors that teaches boxing and trx and she‚Äôs def my favorite instructor! She‚Äôs super motivational and she plays music that keeps you going. She helps you on your form when she sees you struggling but will call you out for using light weights.
There is so much different workouts available at this gym. They offer different levels of boxing and trx! I have tried boxing and trx and loveeeed it.
Don‚Äôt believe me? Give it a try!!<//review>

<Text>Looking for one of the best works outs in the Bay Area? Then this is hands down your gym. I have been a member of Hitfit on Harrison Street for over five years. The trainers are the best of the best. I take Angela and Nia‚Äôs 9 AM class. It‚Äôs only 45mins but they kill me everytime (in a good way!!). They are both very creative - they always change up the work out so I never get bored and there is always something new. Cole and Wayne‚Äôs classes are also incredible. Their training and knowledge is truly impressive. You can tell all the Hitfit trainers are constantly learning and evolving - There is also a really nice sense of community at this gym. I‚Äôve got to know so many people through taking classes. You see the same faces all the time which is obviously a really good sign üí™üèº< /Text></record>

HIT Fit has it all. I've lived in the Bay since 2016 and have trained/worked at several boxing and boutique group fitness gyms, and HIT Fit SF has the organic community vibe that is so hard to come by in a sea of sterile cookie-cutter gyms.

The Nob Hill location has an old-school soul with tons of historic boxing pictures and posters adorning the walls. They even have a ring where you can watch local fighters spar in the evenings. The bathroom area has clean showers that I use to wash up after class because riding home on BART/MUNI can be terrifying if you smell and run into somebody you know haha.

The class offerings are varied enough so that you cannot get too complacent or bored with your routine. Unlike other boxing gyms in the area, they offer TRX classes along with their cardio boxing courses. I cannot stress enough the need for variety in your routine to pursue continuous improvement in your fitness journey over time and HIT Fit nails this right on the head.

They offer Unlimited Memberships that allow you to visit as much as you want each month, and if you are someone that travels for work they also have classpacks that allow you to use at your convenience.

I've heard good things about the bootcamps and personal training as well, and I've seen a program for the kids too. Check it out, you wont be disappointed.</review>

A fun workout while learning how to box. Would highly recommend the bootcamp.

Edit(Oct 2020): the gym is finally open for indoor workouts after the covid lockdown ‚Äì with number restrictions, dedicated training space and sanitization equipment. It's been a pleasure to work with a real heavy bag again!< /Text>

<text>Awesome workouts, professional instructors, friendly staff, boxing galore!  I tried this place out and I'm hooked! I never even thought I would like boxing and I tried the boxing classes and now I do both the HIIT and boxing workouts sometimes two in a row!
What I like is that the instructors are professional. Each of them is in awesome shape and pay attention to technique. I love Cole Nagy's workouts because he always safely pushes limits and always make sure we are safe and doing it correctly. I love Meriem's boxing classes because she's very detailed and helps me become a better boxer. And it's dope to see a fierce woman boxer! I love Wayne's workouts because I can always count on getting a varied total body workout and I love Jamel's workouts because he emphasizes correct form and focuses on slower reps to increase strength and he really really pays attention to our form. If you can do the occasional boot camps at 6am do them! They are a bit too expensive for me generally but I did them for a week once and I absolutely loved them. If I could I would do those every day! Even though I named some instructors, all of them have been dope so you can't go wrong. Each had their own style so you will find your vibe. You get to use weights, trxes, and more! The variety keeps it interesting and you won't get bored! I have been to other places but these are by far my fave instructors.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1562780257006, 'text': 'Thank you for all the trainer shoutouts!

<Review>I have been in this place 4 times. Though I would say that I liked this place during the first 3 visits, the 4th was rather stressful and unnecessary.

I've been taking many classes before, especially kickboxing, but it was my first Boxing class. The instructor was showing a tough facade hoping to push the students to work harder. Unfortunately, along with that tough facade came also insults, swearing, and berating. I've had harder classes before that were also not as uncomfortable.

It is one thing to yell at someone as encouragement. But the yelling was degrading, swearing, sarcastic, and uncalled for. I just have had it with him when he finally  cursed at me and the person I was partnered with because he thought we did not pay attention. But he was the one that did not pay attention, thinking we were doing something not as he instructed. He also commented how one should "get off the drugs."

Quite frankly, I don't think it was a space for learning and developing skills. But obviously the management does not think so after bringing up the issue. Hence, I place the message as a warning for you.

I only bought the 10 groupon classes to try this place out. I may not even finish. I just don't want be in that environment, in case there's more of the type of "instructor" like the one I just had. We will see... so for now the place is an unfavorable 2 stars.<//Review>< response>

Troy King is one of the best coaches I had, and I had many coaches in my life. He makes boxing classes so much more enjoyable and efficient in terms of the learning speed.< /review>

I've been training at Polk St since early 2011 and I'm now in the best shape of my life. The workouts are strenuous, while still being fun, and vary enough to keep things interesting. All of the trainers have different styles and will push you to your limits.<//review>

Jon let me know what my areas of growth were (e.g.work on core strengthening), while also affirming what I did right (e.g. nice jab and hook). I learned the basics of boxing (e.g. "the 1" and "the 2") in just one session. I would definitely return to this gym, as everyone was super friendly and welcoming.

Are you lacking motivation to workout? Yeah, me too and that's why I chose to sign up for this gym! Well, technically, I signed up for the killer GROUPON deal of $49 for 10 boxing classes. They keep the advisement up to let new people like you and I give it a test drive for just about the cost of 7 beers at a bar.

Summer is coming around the corner, and muffin topping is still not a good look. Also, washboarding that mid-section would be a nice addition to our accomplishments this year right? This year is the year!

Cardio kickboxing is a killer workout; from jump roping, hitting the bag and exchanging punches with a partner. I'm only in the beginning boxing class but I've seen the intermediate boxing class and it looks super intense but in a good way.

Beginning boxing class - Do not be discouraged to check out this gym/class whatever exercise level you are. The instructor is super helpful in technique and understands that people in the class are a different fitness levels. I go to the Thursday night classes and its about 40 people and she goes through each row of people (about 4) to ensure that you're doing it right.

I definitely RECOMMEND this gym for someone who wants to get a great workout and make it fun. For me, being on the treadmill and workout bike can get a bit boring. This gym has the boxing classes to make the cardio workout fun while making it a full body workout.

Additionally, the gym has free weights, cardio equipment, tons of punching bags and a boxing ring.< /text>

I remember my 4H summer camp experiences fondly in the 90s & early 2000's. Was the highlight of my summer!! I remember a horse (grey mare) named Mariah that was there at that time and I'm glad she was still around as of 3yrs ago, I remember her being patient, kind, & well trained. Now I live just over the hill in Anza.< /review>

<Text>In 5th grade I came here in 2016 or 2015, don‚Äôt really remember but it was an amazing experience. The cabins were really nice as well as the bathrooms inside the cabins. The food there was great, many options if I remember correctly. In the time period that I was there I think I went horseback riding, rock climbing, did some archery, went to a performance and watched a movie, it was great. Had fun with my friends during my 3 day field trip there. Great experience. Would recommend if possible to go.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I loved it when I went back in November/December of 2015. The food is good, the staff are nice, and cabins are nice. I'm actually surprised how nice the bathroom was. You do so many different activities. I did not go horseback riding (My mom didn't want me falling off) but i did go canoeing twice! We got water bottles and notebooks. Most kids got t shirts ( i didn't i have been expecting one but for some reason it hasn't come in). All these things can make great memories. Not only is it fun but you learn there too. You learn about recycling too. You'll just basically never be bored.It's perfectly safe too. The only thing to be worried about really is getting homesick other than that it will be a blast!  I would want my future kids to go someplace like this.<//Text>

<Review>I had a great experience here. You‚Äôll never be bored as there is so much fun stuff to do. Our naturalist Casey was the best ‚Äúteacher‚Äù I have ever had, she was so nice and encouraging and I wish I could see her again. Pathfinder is a great fun filled place.<//Review>< date>

My daughter has been here twice, and she LOVED her stay! Clean and friendly staff. She went horseback riding, climb the alpine tower, archery, canoeing, and team activities. Make sure the pilot light is on for your cabin's water heater, or you will be taking a cold shower! Just ask a camp counselor.</Review>

<text>The naturalists are nice, fun and funny. The naturalists are people who stay with you whale you do things at camp. The food is good, my favorite meal was at dinner time which was spaghetti. My favorite thing at Pathfinder was climbing  the Alpine Tower. My favorite camp staff member was Ocopy because he has a great sense of humor.<//text>< pictures>

I was accused of stealing a girl's toothbrush and raiding the boy's cabin! The only time I saw the camp counselors were during activities, so the teachers didn't report and strange behavior. I only got to do 4 activities- hiking,  catapults (which was more like the sucky experiments we do in STEM),  canoeing, which was okay, and horseback riding, which I HATED!!!</review>

Pathfinder Ranch is a gorgeous camp with wonderful staff. They made our special event such a personal experience and they were all super friendly and helpful.  Whether you are booking for a corporate event, private get away or sending your kids up for a super educational and enjoyable camping experience Pathfinder is a wonderful place to spend your time. 10/10 can't recommend enough!</review>

I reached out for tax advice, and RJS called me within 3 hours and kindly helped me through my situation, recommending to me a plan of action that didn't even involve engaging them. I greatly appreciated their quick response & no-pressure initial call.</Review>

<review>Could not be happier with the process and the outcome or the legal work that RJS has done for me.  Saved me over $90k in late fees from the IRS and FTB at a cost that was a fraction of that.  Besides the savings, working with them also reduced the stress of working through the process with the IRS and FTB.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

It was a dark, dark day when I found that letter in my mailbox. The IRS wanted their due. And for more than a decade, I had been delinquent. What would happen? Would everthing I owned be gone, my future in turmoil, jail time?? I could barely breathe. But I looked online just to get some info, find out what would happen to me. I called RJS. And the most important words I may ever hear came over the phone "I'll have Chandara Diep call you. She's the best with your situation and I'm sure you'll be ok." I took a deep breath and waited for the call. Chandara called. My voice was shaky, my hands sweaty when she said to me "These things happen, don't worry, we'll take care of it and it won't be as bad as you think."
She was a calming influence and more importantly, a perfect conduit to the IRS. Due to covid, this ordeal lasted more than a year. But through it all, I never, ever, had to deal with an IRS agent. Not once. Everything went through Chandara and the team at RJS. And in the end, I paid a price. But it was certainly only a fraction of what it could have been. And more importantly, my life went on without hardly a hiccup. I can only say that if you are in a tax bind and need help, this call can not wait. It will save you a lot of pain and anguish. You'll see.< /text>

RJS Law came through for me yet again!  I've been a client on and off for years. I can always count RJS and their entire staff.  Not only did they help me right way, as usual, but they offered me fair and very affordable rates.  They're always very professional and I recommend RJS to anyone who has the smallest of tax issues to the biggest.< /Review>

In my dealings with the people of this firm I have been  nothing but pleased. They need no introduction as they advertise everywhere but non the less are down to earth.  I have dealt with several members of the firm, including the principal an enjoyed them all.   As a small business owner myself it says much that I can appreciate them.< /Text>

RJS Law Firm's expertise and exemplary talent are invaluable. Their knowledge, kindness, brilliance, generosity and care constantly amaze me. They are beyond professional and make sure that their clients are well-informed and involved. I know that they are my advocates every step of the way. I can never thank them enough for ALL and EVERYTHING that they have done for me and my family.  I appreciate them more than I can say and there are not enough words to express my gratitude. I fully and wholeheartedly recommend them!!< /Text>

I was really impressed by the professionalism and kindness of Ronson Shamoun, and the thoughtful recommendations, quick turn around time, and  compassion that Jennifer Reardon brought to our interaction. I am very satisfied and grateful. Creating a Last Will and Health Care Directive was a task I've been meaning to complete for a few years - I was kind of dreading it, but Jennifer made it so easy! She was lovely to work with! Thank you both very much!<//text>

<text>RJS LAW is a absolute pleasure to work with. Their staff is outstanding going above and beyond to help in any situation. Their media outreach on current issues and pending changes in the laws is extremely helpful in planning my 2018 business year. When working with RJS LAW you know that you are in good hands. The local community connection they have really shows that they care about San Diego local business. Thank you to the whole team at RJS LAW. I highly recommend.</text>< Date>

<Text>Owner Renae Arabo acts like a concern understanding landlord. She is always trying to look for reasons to make tenants pay extra on top of monthly rent paid. Every year she had raised rent on her tenants. I moved out and complied to agreement. I met with her Feb 2nd, 7pm. She didn't tell me it wasn't clean or she's to repaint. Then 21days comes she deducted cleaning,painting and added the late fees that was waived on agreement. Yet, we had cleaned the yard when we moved in and cleaned everything when we moved out. Do not rent any of her properties. Unless you want to pay more and extra and not get deposit back. Marjsmithers<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>RJS  LAW is a professional and excellent law firm through and through. I have come to them for a couple of different matters and they  were able to take care of  my problems with ease. They were very thorough and answered all of my questions. They made it a point to explain to me what was going on every step of the way. I have referred many family members and friends to RJS LAW and they have all said nothing but positive things. Ronnie is a fighter and never stops advocating for his clients.</text></record></dataset><record>

I have been a client of RJS Law for many years.  Unfortunately, a while back I received some bad tax advice and my former tax preparer did a terrible job, he didn't care and my tax returns suffered.  I ended up owing a large amount of money.  RJS Law helped me back then and they are helping me now.  I was able to get a payment plan with the IRS that saved me from wage garnishments and liens.  Ronnie, Chandara and his entire staff are the best!!  They care about people, they care about their clients and they did all the hard work with the IRS and the Franchise Tax Board so I didn't have to.  I swear by them and I am recommend them to all my friends and family!  They are the best!!< /Review>

Ronson Shamoun and Brad Paladini took excellent care of us with an IRS tax matter that was incredibly stressful for our family. They helped identify that the IRS had made an error, reassured us to calm our stress, kept us informed, answered all of our questions, and persisted with the IRS until the issue was resolved. I'd highly recommend RJS Law to anyone dealing with any type of tax issue, personal, small business or corporate. They truly are the best tax attorneys in Southern California, and they're also wonderful people.< /Text>

I had an extremely positive experience with RJS Law in San Diego. After receiving a confusing and troubling tax notice, I contacted RJS and was immediately transferred to a competent attorney who listened and suggested a plan. RJS executed flawlessly and I was very pleased with the continual updates and quick resolution. Five stars.<//text>

<Review>RJS has been an incredible partner in salving my tax issues. Chandara, Jonathan before along side with Ronnie all along have helped me in a way that I can never thank them for enough.
It tools over 4 years to finally complete the task at hand but I must say that during this 4+ years of patiently waiting and frustration, they have been at my side, trying to serve me the best they could. They succeeded at last, we succeeded at last. I can only recommend this firm to anyone and I did already to anyone with tax problems.</Review><user_id>115920758879752063871</user_id></record></dataset><record>

If your looking for a truly professional and compassionate group to represent you and have by your side for very serious matters I would not only highly recommend RJS, they are must have to go to battle, cause that is what you are about to do.  When your in it its over whelming, you need experience, to feel like your are cared for anytime you call or need some advise, you need to be able to trust your in good hands and this is everything I got when Ronson and his team represented me.   I had a very serious and stressful situation that I got myself into and if I didn't have such a good team behind me in every step of this process, I can't even and don't even want to imagine where it all could have ended. Theres a good reason  why Ronson and his firm have been voted the best firm in this town, its because they are.  Thank you again to all of you at RJS<//review>

<text>One of my clients has a tax problem and we were trying to find out if there was anything that could be done to resolve the issue. I spoke to two CPA's but they did not seem to have the knowledge to help. Finally I spoke to a 3rd CPA who spoke very highly of RJS and told me we should call them so I called right away. I asked for Ronny but he was not available so I was connected with Chandara. I was actually surprised that we were able to talk to an attorney on the first call. Chandara was very knowledgeable and helpful. She even scheduled a conference call with Ronny as well for the next day. They answered all of our questions very professionally even though they weren't able to take the case. This is a much better experience than I have had with other law firms where they are slow and not so polite and accommodating. It was a pleasure to work with them and I would recommend them to others in need of legal advice.< /text><UserId.>111660589662348151022< /UserId.></record>

There's nothing like getting a letter from the IRS or California Franchise Tax Board to get your attention. I was in a panic until I had a chance to sit down with Ronson Shamoun and the team at RJS LAW.
They took the time to listen and help me map out a plan and they helped me solve my tax issues quickly, professionally and cost-effectively.
If you need help with your tax problems--federal or state, the RJS LAW team can help. I know they helped me and they saved me thousands of dollars in the process.</Text>

RJS Law are the best in the business.  I had an extremely complicated tax situation and consulted with several firms.  It wasn't until meeting Ronson, Chandara and their team that I truly felt that I found someone that not only understood my predicament,  but were able to offer concrete advice and a solid plan of action to pursue.  This was after having paid consultations with several other tax firms in the Southern California Area - the team at RJS are far and away the best of the bunch.

What I found most impressive was their knowledge, integrity and empathy.  Let me elaborate on each quality:

Knowledge - these folks know the tax code and associated laws as well as anyone on the planet.  They know the ins, the outs, the loopholes, the pitfalls, and various tricks of the trade.  They also have a wide network of experts in the tax community that they can call on for consultation.  They are a known figure, and they know all the players.

Integrity - unlike some of the other firms I received consultation from, RJS is not looking to gouge your pocket book in your time of weakness.  They provide an excellent service for a reasonable price.  I always felt like the charges were fair, that they were available for an email or phone call any time of the day, and that I was getting great value for my money.

Empathy - perhaps what mattered to me the most was that Ronson and Chandara are real people, who understand the fear and anxiety people face when dealing with the government.  They continually checked in on my emotional state, and were able to calm any irrational fears I had with facts.  You get the definite sense from the entire team at RJS that they are passionate about what they do because it involves helping people.  I always felt that they were in my corner, and it deeply mattered to them that my case had a successful resolution.

I give my highest recommendation to RJS Law.  Give them a call, you won't be disappointed.<//Text>

I've worked with Ronnie Shamoun for several years and RJS Law is my first call when one of my clients needs tax advice.  The lawyers are knowledgeable and professional and the support staff is second to none.< /Review>

<review>Nice local pizza place with friendly staff.  Pizza is really good with soft bread that almost melts in your mouth. Sauce has a little sweetness to it that kisses the taste buds. Garlic knotts are on the New York side. Delicious taste wise but greasy.
Salad is fresh and doesn't wilt quickly like other fast food places.
Overall would recommend</review>< Pictures>

My buddy had mushroom and Canadian bacon I had barbecue chicken pizza with parmesan crust feast meal which comes with salad wings and garlic knots which is an amazing deal in itself. Everything was super delicious but I really really loved the chicken wings! Thank you very much! I'll definitely be coming back here< /Review>< pics>

At the beginning the employees made me feel unwanted when I first stepped through the door. Soon after they realized my only purpose of being there was to pick up an order, they were more helpful ü§è I'll rate them a 3 out of 5 for at least telling me "goodbye"ü§ôIdk what they've been through but my only advice is "give people the benefit of doubt"üôè<//review>

They close too early, and the slices dont have enough sauce on them, but when they are open, you bet youre gonna love a little cheese blanket over the top of your pizza,,,,just say cheese blanket and you will be hooked for life. 5 stars pizza, with the blanket, 4 stars overall. No place to sit and eat.< /Text>

Absolutely disappointing. Just as bad as Little Ceasars but worse because it's expensive for what you get. Ordered ground beef and got pork/beef meatballs cut up into small pieces. Undercooked and made with subpar ingredients. Here on vacay and this place was the worse food so far.< /review>

Porky's Pizza is the single greatest pizza in all of Long Beach. I know I will catch Hell for that, but it's true. Whenever I get the chance this is my go-to pizza. They have your pizza - LARGE Large Size Pizzas, plenty for everyone. They have GARGANTUAN Extra Large Pizzas, enough for King Arthur and his Knights. They have Garlic Knots and Cinna-Knots. They have HUGE salads and the best tasting BBQ wings I've ever had. And quite a variety of sodas. Their delivery is fast and efficient and even their delivery boys are cute as all get-out (gotta love a college town). They even provide plates and utensils and napkins (was in a motel at the time). I always order the feast (not to be confused with the smaller family feast) which is a large one-topping, Garlic or Cinna-Knots, 8 wings (could be wrong on the number). A large salad and a 2liter of soda. You have to try them to believe them. They have several locations, three in Long Beach that I'm aware of, which pretty much covers the city in terms of delivery area. I use the one on 7th and Ximeno near Wilson High School. Moderate pricing, ($35 for the feast) but you so get what you pay for here! Try it out, you will be so glad you did!< /text>

Ordered delivery for the first time. Pizza was cold when it arrived. Ordered two large pizza's and ended up with tons of leftovers. That's because the kids only had one slice. Why one slice? Because they said it was disgusting. I agree. The crust was like hard cardboard with no flavor and the pizza had a strange taste while the cheese seemed gritty. Terrible, and will not go back.<//review>

I'm giving this place 5 stars not because its the best Pizza you could get, but it is really good for quick delivery pizza. Also, and almost as important, the staff (for pickups) and delivery guys are always very nice, quick, and professional. Always feel good ordering here.</Text>

You can never go wrong with a Porky's Pizza.  Always top notch service to go along with the price.< /Review>

This is an amazing South Indian restaurant.  They have wide variety in menu, great taste at reasonable prices. I love their unique menu of Indian desert, that are not available anywhere in bay area. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.<//Text>

Rice was enough for one person. Most other restaurants give only less rice but here it was perfect. Food was good too. Would definitely come back again.</review>< pictures>

<name>Jake B-M</name><time>1611866264445<//time><rating>5</rating><review>Excellent home style vegetarian south indian food. If you're tired of eating the same 5 curry dishes at your regular indian food place, you need to come try what south Indian food has to offer. Amazing food with bold flavors, perfect textures, and just that right amount of heat. I stopped in for lunch and got a combo that was an absolutely amazing deal for the quality and variety of food. So much tastier and more satisfying than any fast food or sandwhich place could ever be, and yet it costs about the same and doesn't take almost any longer. The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming-- they offered to help me choose what to get if I wasn't familiar with the dishes, so don't feel intimidated if you're looking to try out something new.

I'll be back if I'm in the newpark mall area! Thanks for a delicious meal!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

We just took out from here and the food is amazing. Amazing quality, great taste.

I'd definitely see myself becoming a regular here pretty soon!

Definitely not overrated. Worth every 5 star rating. I've been here as early as Nov '19.</review>

Good homely South Indian food is all I can say. There maybe about 25 dishes, but the Vada Sambar and Idli Chutney we had was decent enough. Will come back for seconds.

Order delivery was fast and prices were very good too.<//text>< Pics>

If they can keep up the quality, I bet they ll be Madras cafe of East Bay.<//Review>< Pictures>

Portion of sambar was less then 4 oz and chutney is 1 table spoon of each. Compare of other south Indian restaurant food quantity is not enough. Same price other restaurants unlimited sambar and chutney. I feel like it is not worth price what they are charging.< /text>

Decent food with reasonable prices. It's a little hard to spot as it's in the corner. A good point of reference would be that it's directly opposite to 24 hour fitness at New Park Mall.</Review>

I was in Fremont for a meeting. After the meeting, I was hungry and in the mood of eating south Indian Tamil meals/sapad given i'm in Fremont.

While searching on yelp found this place, where folks review the food taste like homemade food, so decided to try.

Location: seems the restaurant is in office building and plenty of parking available
Ambiance: Super casual dining
Food: Order Thail - south indian meals
* Sambar - Good
* Rasam - Great
* Kara kulambu - Good
* Rice Quantity - Pretty Good, more than i could eat
* Payasam - Awesome
* Mango Pickel - Great, asked for more
* Butter Milk - Great

I would go again here when I'm in Fremont and in mood of homemade tamil food.< /review>

<Review>Excellent food

The food here was really good. Excellent taste, very flavorful, and not too much oil. A rare combination. True to their word, it felt quite homestyle.

We got below dishes:
- Porotta Kurma
- Sambhar
- Mysore Bonda
- Mango Lassi

All dishes did not fail to impress. The Mysore Bonda and Porotta Kurma especially rarely is this well made. The mango lassi too did not have the canned mango taste.

Will definitely visit this place again and highly recommend it.</Review><response>None</response><Time>1575782867690</Time><Pics>None< /Pics><user>114660034198163688270<//user><gmapID>0x808fbf24fb6611eb:0xdf4b80cf231f9fdf</gmapID></record>

Ok'ish place but food was just ok. The most annoying part was how sloppy the service was. Everyone's food was so late and people were getting impatient. They kept delivering the food at wrong tables - the time we were there, we saw them delivering at the wrong table about 6-7 times. How hard is it to get the table right? Once is ok, twice may be but 6-7 times? While the food was ok (not great, just ok), the service is just frustrating. Won't go again.</text>

Newly opened. We had south Indian thali, poori masala and onion masala dosai. All were really tasteful. No blaring music in the background is a relief. Soon this place will become popular among South Indians missing their hometown in India.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) THIS PLACE WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BUT TODAY MONDAY 3 I CAME AND IT IS CLOSED TEMPORARILY FOR MAINTENANCE IS WHAT THE SIGN SAYS IT DOES NOT SAY WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO OPEN IF THEY COME I RECOMMEND THAT YOU TALK FIRST SO THAT THEY DO NOT TAKE YOUR RETURN FROM OKIS ~ _ ~

(Original)
ME RECOMENDARON ESTE LUGAR PERO HOY LUNES 3 VINE Y ESTA CERRADO TEMPORALMENTE POR MANTENIMIENTO ES LO QUE DICE EL LETRERO NO DICE CUANDO VAN A ABRIR SI VIENEN LES RECOMIENDO QUE PRIMERO HABLEN PARA QUE NO ECHEN SU VUELTA DE OKIS ~_~< /Text>

< Review>
Wow! Now I see why this dentist has perfect scores on Google. Everyone was so friendly and professional, from Dr. Engel, to Maria, Wendy And Roland. This is our first visit, but we were so impressed. Dr. Engel is the most thorough dentist I have been to! I highly recommend this dental office<//Review>

Dr Engel takes the time to put you at ease prior to starting his examination he explains everything to you in detail after as well. The dental hygienist really took her time and is very through with the cleaning she also provides suggestions on maintenance. All together very satisfied with initial service. One of the best dental experiences I‚Äôve ever had.</Review>< Pictures>

My family and I have been going here for a couple of years now. I‚Äôve never experienced a better dental office. They are consistently polite, on time, very clean and they test you for things such as oral cancer which I‚Äôve never seen. I also have to thank them for suggesting I go to the doctor because they noticed my blood was consistently high. They take your blood pressure too! This is the first time in my life I‚Äôve trusted a dental office and they earned that. We are customers for life.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>My experience at Dr. Engel's office was like no other - I could write a novel but I will try to make this short. I am absolutely TERRIFIED of the dentist - I have had botched jobs done on my mouth and have been taken advantage of financially by other dentists. Dr. Engel and every single member of his staff have completely dissolved all of my fears. Right off the bat, Maria was warm, kind and bubbly. Roland (who did my X-Rays and assisted Dr. Engel) was very thorough, attentive, and aware of how nervous I was; so he went out of his way to make sure I felt calm, relaxed, and reassured. Then came in Dr. Engel. Even though it was very late in the day, Dr. Engel was incredibly vibrant and took his time getting to know me as a patient, rather than rushing through my exam in the sterile way dentists past have done to me. He took the extra time to thoroughly explain everything that was going on in my mouth in a way that was comprehensive to me. I have never felt so reassured and safe. Next came my cleaning. My dental hygienist (I am so sorry I can't remember her name :( ) was equally as kind, energetic, and helpful; walking me through how to keep my gums and teeth clean and healthy, and thoroughly going over the stages of recovery I should expect in my mouth should I keep on top of my dental hygiene. Then came time to pay. I was nervous - but not for long after Sandy's help. Sandy made sure to help me get the most out of my dental health insurance benefits in a way that made sure I paid the least amount out of pocket possible. She was the icing on the cake and a joy to interact with. I left feeling like a huge weight had been lifted off of my shoulders...and oddly enough, EXCITED for my next dental appointment. When I got home, even my husband was excited to go - WOW! Thank you Sandy, Maria, Josh, Roland, and Dr. Engel - I think it's safe to say my family and I have found our forever dentist.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Dr. Engel,  I started to have major wisdom tooth pain (yeah I know ouch) I called my regular dentist who was close to my old residence and they said come in Dec 3rd. Anyone who has had tooth pain knows that‚Äôs nuts to expect to wait that long. So I had met Dr. Engel at the Chamber of Commerce  before covid life and he always was a charming and likable person.  So now that I moved in the area of his office  I called him and  gave the details of my situation and he actually said can you be here at 4pm which was only 2 hrs from time of call.  So of course I went,  and he did procedure quickly and so attentive to what he was doing he didn‚Äôt leave me for long periods of time it was like being cared for, how your parents  would do (if you have good ones) he has a great sense of humor, makes you feel comfortable and of course great at his craft.  Absolutely love Dr. Engel and his fun team!!!< /Review>< Pics>

I had a feeling this would be a great dentist just first off my experience calling in. The office staff  and especially Sandy were extremely nice over the phone and totally settled my nerves since it‚Äôs been awhile since my last dental appt. Sandy sent great directions and parking information and  kept communication with me even asking if I could send in old X-rays which... is super indicative of who they are as awhole. When I first walked in I was in awe of their office space, it‚Äôs beautiful. Sandy knew my name before I even said it and from there things just continued getting better. Mind you I had my daughter with me and they set her up in her own little room and I was able to keep tabs on her throughout (even random FaceTime calls haha) When Dr. Engel came in he has such an easy going presence to him and was so genuinely invested in my history. I have never ever had a dentist really look at me for my story and not just my X-rays. I literally shed a tear because my teeth have become somewhat  of an embarrassment to me all these years but not with Dr. Engel. He said, ‚Äúyou are here today and that‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù You don‚Äôt realize it but your teeth tie to your health and he reminded me of this even giving me tips and suggestions for not only myself but my daughter. Talk about a dentist who cares!! He made warm handoffs to other specialists in the office and they were all so informative and knowledgeable and patient. Now get this. I was nearing the end of my parking meter and I asked if I could quickly extend time.... the office staff went, found my car, and paid for extra time on my meter!!! I can not make this up. I was more than excited to leave a review. This office deserves all the stars and more. If Dr. Engel or staff reads this, please know you have truly impacted me in ways you will never understand. The world needs more of you all and your practice. Thank you thank you thank you. I highly recommend. Looking forward to going back.</text>

My visit to Dr. Engel's Office was a return to old school.  A time when the patient was not a number, but a real person. The warmth exhibited from the staff was genuine and sincere. I believe that I found a home with Dr. Engel.< /text>

This was the most gentle experience I have ever had. I broke a crown and was in quite a bit of pain. The doctor fixed me up right away and I never felt any pain while sitting in the chair. Normally I get anxious sitting in the dentist chair, but he made me comfortable and reassured me everything was going to be fine. The staff is terrific. Parking is easy. I found my new dentist and I love it.</review>

<Text>Dr. Goldman is the Gold Standard. I was involved in a pretty gnarly accident that resulted in me having acute dental trauma. No dentist wanted to take me on as a case. The only dentist willing was Dr. Goldman. Dr. Goldman is simply incredible. Her calming presence, phenomenal manner and most importantly her fine skills are first rate. Dr. Goldman restored my jaw and smile so that I can face the world again. She is truly an artist and an even more wonderful person.

I have been going to Southern California Dental for over a decade. Since my first visit it has felt like home. The environment is friendly, warm and welcoming. I love the staff here! From the receptionist to the chair it is all very relational. I've never felt like just a number. Dr. Engel is one of the most well informed and intentional doctors I've ever met. He will carefully explain the newest technology or dental discovery so I get to know I am getting the very best. If these things are important to you then I can't recommend a better dentistry.< /Review>

Once again, Dr. Engel lived up to and exceeded his high standard of dental care, at a personal cost to him. My bridge came loose last night. I used the easy-to-use website link to email the office to find out when I might come in for an emergency visit, as the office is currently closed during COVID 19 except for emergencies. I received a message back from Dr. Engel almost immediately saying i could come in this morning at 9:30 AM.  I came, although I was late because I forgot to bring the bridge - and he and two members of his staff were waiting there to meet me. He quickly re-glued the bridge, adjusted the bite, and I was on my way. Dr. Engel and his staff are unfailingly courteous, kind, understanding, and professional. Dr. Engel has been my dentist for about eight years, and I have no intention of changing that, even though I have recently moved farther away than when I first began to receive dental care from him and his team. This is just how they take care of their patients, even those of us who can be forgetful.< /Review>

Sandy is a gem at the front desk. She‚Äôs very kind and helpful, in fact the whole office was. I‚Äôm from out of state and had fears regarding my teeth. They worked with me and helped evaluate the situation without running the bill over $200. Now I can manage my situation until I get home without worry.

Thanks doc!</review>

I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Dr. Engel.
From calming my fianc√© down who is very nervous about the dentist, to also looking at my teeth and explaining everything very thoroughly. I never want to go to another dentist in my life. He helped my fianc√© get into a great oral surgeon for an emergency surgery literally the last day before a holiday weekend. I can‚Äôt thank him enough. He was thoughtful, kind, literally wish all medical doctors were like this. He is a gem and I highly, highly recommend his care. His whole office is also the nicest office I have ever met, thank you guy SO Much!!!!<//review>

<Text>I've been going here for 20+ years since I was a kid getting braces. Dr Engel has always had a world class staff and I've followed them throughout even with changes in location, insurance, etc. They have always been extremely attentive and accommodating explaining every procedure and worked with me on the associated costs, always transparent. And of course, Wendy has been and always will be the BEST!</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1548113307539, 'text': 'Thank you Chris!'}</resp><Name>Chris Saito<//Name><Gmap_id>0x80c2b94f362813b1:0x16ca1aaccd42aefc< /Gmap_id>< Rate>

I have been going to see Dr. Engel and everyone at Southern California Dental Health Associates for years and I always receive the best dental care and service.  Dr. Engel as his staff have always treated me like family when I'm there which is a really nice change of pace from other offices I have been in. I also appreciate how they are always teaching how to really take care of your mouth and prevention so that you don't have to come in anymore than you have to.< /review>

I am a kidney transplant recipient and extremely concerned about Covid.  The office has taken all possible precautions from only one person in the waiting room at a time, all rooms have an advanced air filtration system and Wendy and Jon wore a N95 mask with a cover over that and then a face shield.  I felt as protected as possible. Thank you everyone at the office.  Really and truly the Gold Standard I‚Äôm safe practices.</Text>

Prior to meeting Dr. Engel, I saw several dentists, including a close family friend. But none of them helped me overcome the negative and unnecessary painful dental visits I experienced as a child.
Because of his excellent training an d empathic personality, Dr. Engel has been my dentist for over 30 years. He and his staff  (especially Sandy) have always treated me with warmth and respect....as though II was family.  They have helped me get through many procedures and challenges.  can't recommend them more highly.</Text>

All the products that can be found in this market were very fresh. The food stall was a massive one. Especially the salad bar. It was very convenient to visit this place as well.

<Review>Sprouts has come a long way since the first time I entered one.

We finally went to the sprouts here in Ventura, the store is clean bright with lots of fresh food and a friendly helpful staff.
We like the fact that they always have fresh food, especially fish and the meat dept.
They have excellent sausages and they make are huge and the make some cool burger patties like feta cheddar turkey burger and a jalape√±o cheddar burger patties.

They have wild caught Salmon and not just one piece which seems to be the norm at all the other stores around here which is weird since we are right on the ocean!

The fresh fruit and veggies are on point and take up like half the store. They have a great dry goods section of nuts, fruit and trail mix.

We got a couple of sandwiches from the deli and they were stacked with meat and veggies for like 5 bucks.

The new first stop is sprouts for us. Its whats for dinner.< /Review>< Rate>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>Great customer service in that they will hold a product for me so that it is in stock when I arrive. They have a good selection of the organic products I buy. I like their free range, unseasoned rotisserie chicken. It is fresh and juicy and not loaded down with sodium, MSG, antibiotics, hormones or chemicals. Their organic chicken breasts are fresh, plump and juicy and worth the price.< /Text>< Rate>

<Text>I love this grocery store because they are open earlier than others. They have a great selection of their goods, fresh produce, and meats. Their prices also were very more affordable compared to others that I went to before. The staff is nice too and I find it relaxing doing my groceries here compared to other grocery stores. Highly recommended!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Last week,  I went to this farmer's market.  I got amazed by this place. They've got all  I needed from fresh fruits and veggies to poultry and fish. Also,  they have different kinds of cheese to choose from.  It's like a one-stop-market. I will surely visit this market again and bring my family. Impressive place.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80e84d541db6c1cf:0xd7f36f4de7440ca3< /gmap_id>< Response>

Sprouts is a great grocery chain for your specialty items and items that are on the healthier side. Prices are slightly more, but the quality speaks for itself. The staff and their friendliness just adds to a great shopping experience.< /text>

Very helpful and kind. I did curbside pickup. My online order was ready ahead of time. There were some substitutions, and they checked with me to make sure they were acceptable. They also do a follow up survey. A nice experience.<//Review>

This is the best grocery store for my family's specialty dietary needs! The prices are very reasonable, especially for someone like us who's living on a fixed income. The sales & grocery item selection can't be beat! Plus the friendly & extremely efficient check-out clerks ensure that the lines are kept short, with minimal waiting times. <3<//Text>

I love their bulk section and more thoughtful selection of brands. They recycle sheet plastics so that helps me feel better about the bags in the bulk section. Produce is hit and miss. Some really good items but got broccoli with bugs twice several years apart.<//Text>

<Text>High prices, shop the sales. Their produce is good quality and meats are hit or miss on prices but always good quality. Their frozen section is a NIGHTMARE. I never know the prices since the tags are super small & don't line up to the items. Their vitamin section is good and there are some pretty knowledgeable people in the department and some who could care less.
Checking out I always avoid the young blonde guy. He's been extremely rude like I was inconvencing him by asking him not to sling the meat and berries to the bagging area. The older lady at the first check stand is always sweet. I'll stand in her lane even if the line is longer.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

A little expensive but far less than Whole Foods and they have a great produce selection very healthy natural products that I wasn't able to find other places that have a great jelly great butcher shop and now that I think about it it's really not that expensive maybe on certain things are few dollars more than Von drehle is a very special place especially if you eat healthy< /review>

<Review>I am a Sprouts gal. But, truly this is one of the best Sprouts (if not THE BEST)  I have been to and now WILL regularly go to.  May they keep up the excellent service, quality merchandise, groceries and most important, upscale business attitude.</Review>< userid>

<review>I love shopping here all the staff is very friendly and helpful and the store doesn't smell nasty like other grocery stores. I would have to say there greatest thing about this store is the meat department the guys know there cuts and what to make if you can't figure it out . John in the meat department has saved me a had full of times showed the wonderful one pan meals. Gave me a great recipe for the spinach feta sausage the whole crew is great definitely a good team there . From the bagger cashier any department this store is great and the folks very helpful .< /review>< Pictures>

Customer service here is terrible. The actual store has a good selection of products and the bulk section is so great. However the cashiers at this Sprouts need to be let go or get better training. They should take a page from Trader Joe‚Äôs book. No one even comes comes close to their high quality customer service and that is why Trader Joe‚Äôs is my go-to.< /text>

I don‚Äôt usually shop here but I was in the area and needed a couple things so I went in. I purchased my items and they bagged them for me... forgetting to bag one of my items. I call the store to see if they can remedy this situation and all they can offer is for me to come in and get a refund or come in and get my items. Well I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs not good enough. It was 100% their mistake and now my baby is screaming and I have no time to go in. I guess I‚Äôll get my $2.99 refund next time I‚Äôm in the area. Thanks for nothing.< /Review>

<Review>This store customer service is amazing! I am a fairly new professional shopper and learning Sprouts lay out and products. When ever I need help EVERYONE in this store is happy and willing to help, including taking the time to go outback to check for stock. This is so important because as a team we are helping fullfill  online orders.  I don't know everyone names but two people who I would like to give a shout out to is Alex and James. These guys are always positive, professional and unbelievably helpful. Thank you Sprouts Ventura team for working with me as a team to keep our online shoppers happy and loyal customers. By completing these orders as efficient as possible, as a team,  is so unbelievably important and I can count on this store to be a team player.<//Review>< pictures>

The store itself is ok but do not, and I mean DO NOT buy a sandwich from this place. There is an old white man who makes sandwiches and he is terrible! He  made one sandwich in the time it took another woman to make five! Then the sandwich doesn't even come out right. The guy is nice but he really shouldnt be making people's lunches.<//text>

<Date>1542141237784</Date><review>I wanted to love this company but this store has some of the worst customer service that I‚Äôve ever experienced at a grocery store. I can deal with the common occurrence of items constantly being out of stock but what I cannot deal with is the blantent rudeness of the employees. Upon asking a male employee if he could check if they had a particular item in the  back 2.5 hours before the store is scheduled to close, I asked an employee if he could check if a particular creamer was in stock (said creamer has been out of stock in the store for the past four times I‚Äôve visited no matter what day/time I‚Äôve gone) to which He reluctantly responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs pretty late now but fine‚Äù.... too late?.. Before leaving to check out the items They did have in stock I unwillingly heard an entire conversation of other employees in uniforms congregating by the beer discussing their ipa and stout preferences, etc.. maybe their time would have been better spent helping out other customers.. or their disgruntled coworkers who also have no interest in helping a mother with her baby. On another occurrence, a middle aged female grocery checker had an open and audible conversation with the bag checker regarding their displeasure about how ‚Äúpeople shouldn‚Äôt be doing their grocery shopping so late and how it isn‚Äôt fair that they still have to be working right now). If you‚Äôre store is open and this is your shift, then yes, expect to have customers purchasing items... speaking poorly of customers while they‚Äôre right in front of you is a rudimentary concept of what NOT to do. Upon reading other reviews, it seems as though customer service is a common issue at this location. In a previous review, on man brought up in a how he believes many of the employees have been discriminating against customers based on race.  I too am a woman of color and I am now considering this to be a possibility which is why I will no longer be supporting this store.<//review><user>106142661249479252818< /user>< gmap_id>

Love the store but the front end needs work. The cashiers have absolutely no sense of urgency. They never take the NEXT CUSTOMER IN LINE! I was in line tonight and the line was long. A second cashier came to help and instead of taking me the next in line, with only 4 things stuck & behind a huge order she takes the customer with another huge cart behind me. To add salt to the wound the lady go checked out before i did!! Didn't catch the lady's name because her badge was flipped over so the name couldn't be seen. Teal shirt, dark brown hair with a nose piercing.<//text>

<time>1491508016071< /time><Text>Just checked out the new store and I really enjoyed it! The selection is great (much better than Trader Joe's). There are so many areas with a great selection, I'll just name my highlights. Asian section: lots of sauces, pastes, noodle and rice variety. Veggies: many less common veggies available. Particularly chilis. They dont have every chili I could want, but having more than just jalape√±os is a start! Meat section is much bigger than Trader Joe's. The prices looked pretty reasonable - although I haven't done a trip yet for my weekly groceries.  The layout of the store is very open, which makes it easy to find things as well as being inviting. I hate stores that have teeny tiny aisles and induce claustrophobia...(Trader Joe's) The store was staffed very well for their second day of business. Everyone working there was super nice and seemed to have such a positive attitude. Like they were excited to be there. I had such a great experience - I hope my weekly trip is a reasonable price because I like the store a lot!< /Text>< user>

<rate>1< /rate><text>ATTENTION!. This place is a beautiful place, but VERy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!√ó10 RACIST. I'm a young "white" man who's a Dr Married to a beautiful woman of color. While I happened to be in the vitamins department I watched my wife from afar and saw that, she was not welcomed nor did anyone ask her if she needed anything.  But I observed that whenever a white person walked in they were praised. Until check out this was where I had it. She was just about to be rang, but a short blond elder lady came, and asked her to live the line and asked her to check out where a young girl of color her name is Tai, who also happened to be the casher... Then I saw them all laugh at her my "wife" as she walked away. I was angry, so then I went were my wife was checking out before she was redirected, and the lady said "WELCOME" and checked me out. Wow!!!!.. and so I decided to take this to a higher authority. So people reading this, it's no joke.. people of color are not all bad just like us. When you see this happen speak up....

Not exactly local produce, I asked the produce clerk if the produce came locally and he said it comes from inside the US which is great but with Ventura being so rich in agriculture you'd think they'd bring in local FARM FRESH produce.  It would be great if they could bring in local goods like Whole Foods does. Can you guys change your music?  The music is the worst, they play the 'latest hits' and who listens to that garbage but my kids, haha. Anyways how about some old school music like The Beatles or The Clash. Trader Joes ALWAYS has the best tunes, please tune on to whatever channel they are on! There is still some room for improvement Sprouts!  Overall its a beautiful store with good foods and fair prices plus happy people working there. There are a few snooty teenagers that work there but that could  have been employees from other stores that came into this store to help for opening week. Sprouts change your music and bring in local!</review>

<Time>1496090300764</Time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>My husband and I recently went to the Sprouts store @ 4870 Telephone Rd. Ventura, CA 93003 to purchase some salad dressings and Hemp Milk.They're a little pricey, but they have great products that we have not been able to find elsewhere. However, this was a horrible experience.......

My husband and I checked out at the register that Manager: Konnie was working at. Everything was seemingly fine at first. We asked her to split the bill between two cards and she said it was fine. When she ran the first card, she looked up and said, "Oh, it ran the whole amount. Well, I pressed $8.50. Have a good night, goodbye." And continued to greet the next customer. My husband then said "Excuse me....you didn't apologize or offer to fix it or anything...I find that quite rude." To which she replied in an exhausted manner, "I can refund it if you want and recharge...". My husband then brought up the point that she didn't even apologize or anything..just sort of brushed it off. We asked to speak with her manager. She replied, "I am the manager." We asked where we could make a complaint. She replied" Excuse me, I am manning the register. I will not be rude to my customer." Then proceeded to ignore us as she greeted the next person in line with a huge smile. I said "But...WE are customers as well..." She continued to ignore us. We then asked a young man close by if there was a manager we could speak to.....he pointed at Konnie. I then walked towards the vitamin section of the store, vocally asking for a manager for help.

On top of that...As I walked towards the exit...I heard Konnie talking about my husband and I to other customers she was checking out, and then she said "Can you imagine how I FEEL right now?", laughing.  While a (what I think was) a security guard (older gentleman) followed me out.

I just couldn't believe it. And after all of that, I emailed the district manager of the company, Brett D'Amico. This was his reply: "Thank you Tara for your email. I have followed up with our team and appropriate protocol in situations to ensure customers are taken care of.

Brett"

No apology.....no real solution....not really a clear answer.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80e84d541db6c1cf:0xd7f36f4de7440ca3</GmapID></record>

It was chaotic. I was ignored at first and overlooked a few times by hairstylists who didn't want to take me on because I was just a cut and style (not enough money IMO). I even had an appointment and still nothing. I was finally FINALLY set up with Susi. And OMG was she amazing AMAZING. I got an Aline cut from her and she knew exactly what she was doing. I will definitely return only because of Susi (she gets 10 üåü stars).<//text>

En Vogue Salon is a very cheerful place to go to and is always clean and has excellent hairdressers. I would highly recommend this place to anybody who wants to leave looking beautiful they also have a nail lady who is very nice my personal favorite hairdresser is Patty and she's been doing my hair for 22 years!!!<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Made an appointment, went in 15 minutes early, gave them my name and the stylist they made the appointment with for me and the appointment time. They said, 'oh, okay'. So I took a seat in their waiting area. Appointment time, no one says anything. Fifteen minutes pass, still no acknowledgement. I stand up at the front desk after waiting forty five minutes, still no acknowledgement that I am even there. I walked out. Sitting there watching, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.< /text>< Pics>

I booked appointment on phone and they said we charge $200 for Japanese hair straightning ..I asked clearly on phone two times that is this $200 .. she said yes for every type of hair we charge $200 but after she done my hair she asked for $250 .. and she have tones of excuses... then she said give me $225 ... I was so pissed ... and I m not happy with the hairs she didn't iron them properly.. my hairs are still curly ... very much upset please if u r going for Japanese hair straightning go somewhere else ... üò°üò°üò°üò°</review>

Love the food over here. It's Lao/Thai cuisine. Must get dish is Champa Sampler (sausage, rice salad, egg roll, & noodle) to eat with lettuce. Very affordable price even though the restaurant increased a bit due to inflation but still cheaper than SF. My other favorite dish is pad see ew, amazingly tasty. Easy to find parking.</Review>

<text>Hidden gem of Oakland. It‚Äôs intimate, homey and incredibly delicious. The glittering string lights out front clued me in to the magic waiting inside. There can be a wait, but it‚Äôs worth it. Food is authentic and interesting‚Äîget the angel wings for an explosion of gluttony‚Äîbut stay for everything else. It‚Äôs very reasonably priced too, especially given that I usually leave with lots of leftovers.<//text>< pics>

<pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Name>Sabrina Mah</Name><Review>The food is okay. I‚Äôve never hated the food, but nothing to write home about. The papaya salad is pretty bland, thai version. No spice at all, and really no flavor. I‚Äôve ordered it at least three or four times hoping I just got a bad batch, but its always the same.

The avocado spring rolls are huge though and pretty good. Very fresh, but they break apart and its almost impossible to eat without utensils. Curries are solid.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This place is so delicious. The flavors are wonderful in every bite! Must get the Champa Sampler. We got that and a duck curry. That was more than enough food for two people. The portions and prices are really good. I can't wait to go back. We went on a Friday night, the wait wasn't too bad an hour before closing.< /Review>

< Review>
I had pinned this place from yelp a couple weeks ago and just got to try it out last weekend. Literally 10min away from Lake Merritt hidden in a residential neighborhood in Oakland. We went there at opening dinner time just after 5 and let me tell you, we were surprised the place was packed!!! We knew then the place was THAT good!!! The menu was full of choices - we opted for the fresh shrimp rolls with garlic sauce, the egg fried rice and catfish curry. Oh my God!!! The portions were great and we thought we would have to take leftovers home - boy were we wrong! The food was so amazing we overate! Too Good! Hadn't had such an amazing food experience in a long time. Thumbs up for the great flavors and addicted taste! Champa Garden we will be back in no time!< /Review>

They served in our table all the foods, wines, and desserts. I was delighted with their excellent treatment and accommodation. My fiancee and I were happy to be here at this wonderful restaurant. One thing was for sure, the recommendations that I made reached to all of my friends.

The food here is delicious!
A lot of places are not providing the same "good quality" foods during quarantine, however, that was not the case at Champa! The food was delicious, thank you.< /text>

<text>I have tried many different Thai restaurants around the bay area and Champa has the best pad thai to my opinion. It is very flavorful and it is not too sweet like some other restaurants. I love all of the noodle dishes, but the only down side is that the meats (beef specifically) are generally rough and hard to chew. I like the curry dishes as well. Although the sampler is one of their most popular dishes, the crispy rice is not crispy enough to me. One thing that I notice is that during Covid time, the food quality went down by a little. It is still good, but not as good as before.</text>< response>

This place has definitely gained popularity since we‚Äôve moved here four years ago. It‚Äôs always busy and fortunately their take out ordering is pretty quick. But if they‚Äôre really busy it‚Äôs also hard to get them to answer the phone because it‚Äôs always busy. For vegetarians, the options are pretty good, most things can be made with tofu. The Thai fried rice is really good but sometimes it‚Äôs inconsistent with flavor. Other favorites Pad Thai & Pad Se-Ew noodles.<//Review>

Got the red curry, which was excellent. Free bottle of water per customer, and free sugar packets/pre-portioned spices in little plastic containers. Cheers!</review>

Flavors are on point.
The angel wings batter not so much; it was flat and greasy. I wouldn't order those again.
The mango sticky rice was delicious.< /Text>

I have come here two times and the second was a lot better! That's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.
The price is good, the place is not the most comfortable, but is Cousy, and the food is really good!!!
Try the tai tee and one of their soup noodles.< /text>

<text>I love the food at this local restaurant, and I have been trying to support our local businesses - but the take out experience was terrible! So many things were wrong. I called the restaurant and placed my order using the menu on line. Based on the menu, my total should have been $39.  When I picked up, the total was $69 - which they claim are the "new" prices. That may be, but they need to change the price they advertise on line. Then, one $10 item was missing, and they stopped answering the phone, so it couldn't be fixed. The Thai Iced tea had a lid that did not fit, and leaked all over my car. The mango sticky rice was in a container that also leaked and the milk was in the bag. Sorry - I cannot support this!<//text>< username>

Two separate visits - delicious each time. First tried a noodle soup, next a pan-fried dish. There are a lot of food options to picking two was enjoyably difficult and I doubt I‚Äôd have been disappointed with any of the choices. Orders were done fast, veggies were fresh and prepared perfectly, and the wait staff were personable and despite probably serving over 100 people each day, they recognize me each time I go in and remember my order when I‚Äôve done pick-up. Great, comfortable, well-priced dinner spot.< /text>

Although in my opinion the food isn't quite as good as it was 5-6 years ago, Champa is a standby, always crowded, always tasty.  Their larb is one of the best around, the somtam is great, and there are lots of other stars as well.

So many people just get the stuff they know or sounds easy; be adventurous, ask for some advice, get some items you're not familiar with.<//review>

<Review>We live Champa gardens so much!  A little bit secret, hiding back from n the neighborhood. They make the most delicious food.  Truly every dish is excellent.  The sausages are super great, get those, the curries are excellent, the veggies are fresh.  Have a a cold beer with some hot food.  They are small so it can get pretty busy.  You can also do orders to go.  Because it's in a neighborhood, parking can be difficult at dinner.  The prices are also very reasonable, especially for the quality.  Another Oakland gem!  The only thing that is bad, is they don't make the peppermint beef anymore.</Review><response>None</response>< date>

<text>We came here for lunch on Friday.  You have to pay attention to parking signs in this area.  We got a 2 appetizers and each ordered an entree.

Good little neighborhood restaurant.  Their fried mango rice was delish.  They have pho, pan fried noodles, and other Thai, Lao, and Cambodian dishes. Beer (Thai, Myanmar), wine, and sake available.</text>

The rice ball salad and mango sticky rice were by far the standout items, but everything was delicious. I've heard the wait can be bad, but we were seated immediately at 7:00 on a weekday. Great place to bring people who want to try something new!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

A Laotian restaurant at heart but serving a mix of Thai and Laotian recipes. This neighborhood restaurant is often busy for good reason. You can generally adjust fish sauce and spice level on dishes...and can really spice things up with some of the chili sauces on the side. There's a mix of Asian and domestic beers (probably wine too) to compliment. Never been disappointed here.<//Text>

Expect a 30-60 minute wait at dinner time.
Yes, late in the service if it‚Äôs crazy busy the food quality is definitely less. For example; your curry will be mostly gravy and onions. (Sorry guys, it‚Äôs true!)
Get the fried spring rolls!!!
Just plan your visit a little and you‚Äôre in for a treat! It‚Äôs seriously delicious, spicy, flavorful food. There‚Äôs a reason the wait is long, it‚Äôs worth it!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808f873d3dae1d95:0x6192722233679647< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>The appetizer sampler is great!! Gives you the famous rice salad, fried spring roll, and sausage. I really enjoyed the house special, which is fried catfish and eggplant smothered in a spicy sweet sauce. Also would recommend the Lao's Vermicelli, which is a curry noodle soup with rice noodle and chicken. I'm definitely going to go back here! They have a location on ocean in SF too!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Very busy neighborhood thai and lao spot. Good prices, cheap beers in bottles, and speedy service. If you're in the mood for fhis type of cuisine, don't skip it.</review>

The people in the neighborhood know this is the best restaurant in the area. If you want to get a seat, either show up really early or after 7:30. The Champa sampler, Lao sausage, duck larb, and tofu tom kha soup are the best.</Text>

delicious mix of laotian, thai and viet flavors in an authentic setting (including a pretty hot night which made it feel like being in SE asia).

can't miss the nam khao. absolutely exceptional flavors and textures in this traditional dish.< /text>

<Review>Never really had a bad experience here. The food is great and service had been an evolution from ok to great as time went on. Remember to get the Champa sampler. It's the best. Can't go wrong with chicken laarp or the papaya salad to name a few. While not quite a hole in the wall, it is located in a neighborhood.</Review>< pics>

Wow! It smelled amazing down the block from this place! Ordered some excellent pad-thai and my wife got a vegetable hot-pot and it was delicious. The server doesn't rush you here (also helped we went around 2PM) and its a very relaxed atmosphere. Great place to eat.</Review>

Look, the food is fabulous. Get the Champa sampler for an appetizer, definitely order the sticky rice, but the rest of the menu is your playground. Save some yum nam tok for me, though! It's lime marinated beef with mint and peanuts, and it's the best. One star off because I don't want anyone else to go here, it's busy enough already!< /review>

OG champa garden got a face lift! Same good food from years ago, though. Come early or be prepared to wait a little.</Review>

< review>
I'm sitting in my car a few thousand miles away feeling something akin to homesickness for when this wonderful restaurant was walking distance from my home. It always picked me up.

I was never disapointed and one day I plan to fly across the country at least 42% because I want to eat here again and introduce it to my wife.

Try the rice ball salad!</review>

<Text>I want to have big neighborhood pride but I just find Champa Garden too frustrating to do business with anymore.  They've never had adequate phone equipment to be able to hear orders.  The website died 2-3 years ago and they couldn't be bothered to fix it -- third party sites have old versions of the menu.  Sometimes they don't answer the phone.  They're very inconsistent about stated time to pick up vs actual time the order will be ready.  Sometimes it can take 15-20 minutes just to get someone to take the money (I used to just leave the cash on the counter and leave.)  All this and the food just isn't what it used to be in terms of price or quality.

The straw that broke the camel's back was calling in and having the phone answered, but put down on the desk twice in a row for over 5 minutes.

It's not like it's hard these days to automate order taking eg on the web.  Tell me when Champa Garden gets their act together.<//Text>< userid>

Great Thai/Laotian restaurant. I have been going there since they opened tears ago and never get tired of their food! My current favorite: Crispy Springrolls.< /Review>
</record>
</dataset><record>
<text>One of the best restaurants in the Bay area. Been coming here since it opened. First it was tom kha and the pad thai. Then it was the fried spring rolls and rice ball salad...then everything on this menu ive tried has been so effing good! What did me in though, was the Lao Noodle Soup. Homemade rice noodles that takes up half the chef's day to make only to end up in this bomb a$$ noodle soup. Its amazing as it is healing.</text><user_id>115610192637843446755</user_id>< pics>

I do love champa garden, it's near my partner's house so we go all the time... but I do have to say the quality is starting to sag. I know it's a secret trick in asian cuisine to add sugar to enhance taste but the Tom Kha has so much sugar it's actually sickening. I needed soup when I was ill and it was a terrible waste of my money. Also, I tend to order to go... WORD TO THE WISE >>> if you pay for extra anything, check the box before you go. I paid for double the shrimp in my fried rice. There is no way 5-6 pieces is double. The tofu fried spring rolls are good ... but again... that dipping sauce. SO MUCH SUGAR.< /review>

Champa Garden has definitely become our new dinner spot. They serve up tasty Lao and Thai dishes  that will make you continue to salivate long after your should've stopped eating. We like to take friends, order a few dishes, and serve it up family style.

Heads up they're pretty strict about closing on time so don't be upset if you show up half an hour before closing and they won't seat you. Also, expect to wait up to an hour if you show up at peak dinner time. This place gets packed. But in my experience, once you've been seated everything goes by pretty quick!

Minus one star for serving the Thai iced tea in single use platic cups when we were dining in, sorry.</review>

<text>I read about this place years ago and told my wife about it so we were excited to go. We found a place to park right away, walked in and was surprised how nicely decorated it is, busy but extremely well organized. There was a wait list you entered yourself on an iPad. People were streaming in and out getting their to go orders along with Doordash.

However, there is a extremely strong smell of fish sauce when you step inside the door. We kind of adjusted as we waited for our order. They got our food out quickly and we took it home to Concord. All of the food was doused with fish sauce and the noodles were mushy and one dish had no flavor at all besides the fish sauce.

A lot of customers had Pho and they seemed to enjoy it. Maybe we'll try the Pho if we're in the area  but maybe no since I  spent $50.00 on food we didn't enjoy at all.< /text></record>

<Response>None</Response><Text>This place is a very casual Laotian restaurant.  Don't expect the best customer service. The cuisine is a cross between Vietnamese and Thai food. I ordered the crispy rice appetizer and it was delicious! The chopped scallions really added a lot to the dish as well as the lettuce wraps. The whole dish tasted fresh and well-balanced with all the greens, since it is a fried dish. The pad see ew was okay. I've had better elsewhere. The panang curry was delicious. Make sure to ask for the condiment tray (huge tray with spices and sauces) to make your dishes more spicy. The best part was that the bill came out to $24 for two people. Amazing!</Text>< time>

<review>Food is great, but twice out of the two times I went there they ran out of rice. The second time they didnt tell us until after we had waited a long time for our food. we were served just dishes and expected to eat them without any rice. Not very apologetic about it either.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>I never had Laotion food until I came here. Most dishes have a more familiar Thai version or go for the unique and adventurous with some of the Laotion variations. The papaya salad was far different and less sweet in the Laotion style. The spring rolls are a great appetizer to share or as an entree. They come crispy and served with noodles and lettuce to wrap them up. Really unlike any spring rolls from anywhere else and the whole fried tilapia was like being transported back to SE Asia.

This place isn't hard to find but it is not where you would expect to find a gem like this. Definitely a must try!<//Text>< Rate>

3rd time...I did not like the food..nothing wrong with it but it was not good. Maybe cook changed?? Server was out of space..they don't watch the customer..three servers, 4 tables...never came to ask, if we need anything else.. payment Cash only...it will take long time for me to return again.<//text>

<review>Interesting menu with lao/thai/cambodian influence. I would say it is authentic based on my experience of thai and cambodian food. Vegetarian friendly as well (I'm not sure about vegan). Inconspicuosly located in a residential area. Food comes out fairly fast and place is usually bustling with people---busier during dinner time. Does not have a parking area so you need to find street parking and not block someone's driveway.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Then there was this young kid with a hat. Trying to act cool but coming across rude. I sat down. The kid came and slips the menu on the table then walks away without asking if I want water or any drinks.

Service is really whack here.

Wasted good 20 minutes of my lunch time thanks to them. Not coming back here because I do not trust these types of kids to handle my food even if it is just to bring it from the kitchen table to my table.<//Text>< Date>

Worst pad thai I ever tried... noodle with tomato sauce and few tofu & chicken dice. Where were the veggies? They might desserved a good reputation 1 or 2 years ago but now it's just overrated. People are still going there because it's the only restaurant of the area.</review>

The avocado rolls were great, the pumpkin curry  was wonderful, great thai tea on coconut milk and even the sticky rice was great. Almost everything we wanted was easily veganized ‚ù§Ô∏è

But...
The drunken noodles didnt arrive. 15 minutes after we finished all the above food, they saif it's going to take a lot more time for it to come. But at least they were cool about us cancelling it and leaving

The avocado rolls didn't come with the peanut sauce.... We asked them, and they said its not  supposed to come with it. We showed them the paper menu, they said its old. W showed them the normal menu, and then they agreed....

And for a starter, a main and a 3$ drink we paid 30$. That's too much for this kind of (very tasty) restaurant< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>2nd best Thai papaya salad ever. Spicy like it should be. Not make your ears tingle spicy but close. Service was quick and attentive. Crowd was a little to white and hipster but it's.friday in oakland. It would have gotten five but the chicken in the curry and satay tasted like old rooster. Peanut sauce left something to be desired.< /Review><Time>1486784844543<//Time>< GmapID>

The food is pretty good, though expect a long wait for a table. I woudl highly recommend teh appetizer sampler, just because it has a little bit of everything which is great to try. Their papaya salad is pretty good, and their mango sticky rice is the best way to end your meal here.< /text><Time>1422572417927</Time>< Pictures>

I love the food here. Delicious. A mix of Thaai, Cambodian and Vietnamese dishes but it works because of thr heritage of the family owned restaurant nestled in this residential neighborhood. Sometimes there will be people outside waiting. Yup itd that good. Service is fast. No frills. Just fresh delicious Asian flavors.< /review>

This hidden gem of Thai and Laos food is amazing! It's tucked away in the neighborhood but there's always a line! Their pad se-ew is mouth watering and make sure to get your thai tea for $2!

Got a date? Make sure to impress him/her with some mango over sticky rice dessert or the coconut ice cream with fried banana dessert. =)</Review>

The service I just received was nothing less than atrotious.

I ordered chicken pad Thai, sticky rice and Thom Ka soup for takes-out at 5:06. At 5:55 my meal still hadn't arrived. I watched my friend get served within 15 minutes-  and she came 15 minutes after me and she was treated well and with courtesy. It was 5:35.

I thought nothing of it, so I sat and waited. 5:40.

Three people walked in after me, ordered for pick up and got served. They came at various times-5:30ish, 5:20 ish, 5:40 or so, and got served.

That's not the end of it. Not yet.  I counted three or more tables with more than three people to each table who also came after I ordered get, you guessed it, served.

Now mind you I'm sitting right in front of the table where the cashier is located and where they place all the orders. They would look at me waiting, waiting and waiting without informing me about the status of my meal and why it's so late. They didn't have the courtesy to speak to me and would pretend they were too busy for me.

They ignored me and politely smiled and asked each new person coming in " may I help you sir? How many people in your party?
I'm clearing the table right now for your party" and withing less than a minute they were seated. 15 to twenty minutes, served. I continued to wait.

I'm one person who ordered three items for take out who sat right in front of the servers, waiters, cashier,  etc. And not only was I ignored, but when they finally talked to me they blamed the person who took my order and said " something is wrong with the cashier machine and paper" huh!? But yet everyone else around me got their orders with no "cashier machine is broke" excuses. No, they got served and I got excuses and still waited. Waited. Then I cancelled my meal and had to wait while they processed my card and return my funds , that took an additional 10 to 15 minutes for them to do that, and I still f#&$'3&* waited.

So, after an hour later, they processed my refund and still I waited because they forgot to inform me that my debit card was credited back to my funds!

So, what did I get for this piss poor service? A free chicken pad Thai!

I have never wrote such a scorching review of any restaurant. Never. Ever. But this was the last straw. I've lived in this neighborhood for years. I ate in this restaurant, told my friends about it and was even proud of the quality of the food at the best prices around.  But not anymore.

Things have gotten worse, much worse, within the past 4 years or so which I assume is due to getting more popular and more growth. With this have come growing pains and I believe they don't have the right infrastructure and resources to adequately serve them all.

I would order from them on many occasions in the past and I noticed my wait time increasing each time and tonight was the last straw.

I was one of your loyal customers, but not anymore. I will tell my friends about you, I will  post this review to other websites and  I will not patronize your establishment again.< /Text>

What a hidden gem!

I wasn't able to order the sampler (which is their most popular dish) because I don't eat meat. But I tried the egg rolls and they're my favorite that I've had! They have a different wrapping, and eating wrapped with the lettuce then dipping it in fish sauce was delicious.

Laos larb was an interesting dish. The duck curry, garlic shrimp, and thai tea are all good! I ordered the pad kee mao the first time I came, and it was really bland. So avoid this dish if you can and try and order their specials.

Come during an off time so you don't have to wait!

Tip: There's websites that have coupons which make dining here even more affordable!</Review>

<review>There's always a crowd and a wait but it's totally worth it. Where else can you get such great flavorful food at such a cheap price without actually flying to South East Asia? Personal favorites here are the Nam Kao, Kao Soy and Kao Poon. Can't forget the mango sticky rice for dessert.< /review>< pictures>

Frenzied little Laotian/Thai/Lue joint on a random residential corner in East Oakland.

Champa Garden hasn't done what most ethnic restaurants do: tone down the flavors to not offend. The papaya salad (get it Lao style!) packs a wallop. As Padma says, sometimes you just want to get hit in the face with shrimp paste.

Definitely not a flavor that'll please most, but if you can get past all the waves of pungent and fermented seafood, there's a lot to marvel at before the spiciness slams you in the aftertaste.

The Lue noodle soup was great. Big wide rice noodles in a red pork broth, plenty of fragrant oil floating about.

Definitely get the rice ball salad to start, and the catfish dish was rocking as well. Big chunks of fish in a curry sauce, with lots of veggies to round it out.</Review>

<text>This place is a flavor bomb!!!! The Champa Sample is a must-order. It includes Laos spicy sausages, vermicelli noodles, mushroom + silver noodle egg rolls, and fried rice ball salad with fish sauce on the side! I love ordering the most exotic sounding dishes on the menu when I try out a new cuisine (I've never had Laos before, but the flavor palette seems close to Vietnamese and Thai). Naturally, the fried rice ball salad caught my eye. What on earth is a fried rice ball salad?! It's crispy goodness, including fried rice (OMG A SALAD WITH CARBS?! HELL YES!) mixed with preserved pork, green onions, peanuts, cilantro, mint leaves, and lime juice.

We also got the angel wings, which can be best described as a spring roll wrapped inside a deboned chicken drumstick. Drizzle some of that sweet and sour sauce on top and you got a ticket straight to deep fried heaven!

The mango fried rice was also delightful. My boyfriend is usually staunchly a noodle guy, but even he caved to this magical dish. The Laos-style beef larb was not as pungent and flavorful as I would have hoped, but it was still delicious.

Service and atmosphere was mediocore. The staff seemed on the unfriendly and on the shy side, but nothing horrible. For such a cozy establishment, I think it goes a long way for customers to be greeted with a big smile and at least some level of enthusiasm. Sadly, I felt like my excitement over the food and the menu was not shared by the host or our waitress.</text><user_id>118373223335675400587< /user_id></record></dataset><record>
