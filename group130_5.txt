< review>
I had a flat 14.5 lowboy tire that had a nail in it. 5 min and $15.00 later the guy at Arandas tire was putting the patched tire in the back of my truck. Fast and friendly. Arandas tire shop is open 7 days a week. It's across the street from Weiner Schnitzel on Stockton blvd.< /review>

My daughter went in to see Dr.Boaz for hip pain (from playing indoor volleyball). She is so happy she went - she feels so much better after just one appointment even though we will have a couple more, I think. Dr. Boaz was very pleasant, explained everything beforehand in simple language. it was super easy to make an appointment, and the driving directions (that came in an email along with an appointment reminder) were easy to follow. Highly recommended!!<//text>

I went to see Dr. Bronner and my experience was wonderful.  He really listened to your concerns and does what is best for you. Dr. Bronner really cares about his patients. After discussing my health goals and worries he order blood work and gave me a healthy diet to improve my health. And explain everything to me. He is very knowledgeable, professional, and kind. I feel so lucky to have found him. I highly recommend him.</Review>

Dr. Bronner is exactly the doctor I have been searching for since arriving in San Diego in 2009.  My co-worker referred him and I feel I am finally back on the right path towards holistic wellness.  The initial consultation was a very informative and educational session for me.  Dr. Bronner thoroughly explained what was happening in my body and how to approach it.  They did a thorough lab work up on me which Dr. Bronner reviewed with me in a phone consultation two-weeks later.  Immediately following our phone consultation he sent me a cholesterol-busting protocol and supplements I could order on Amazon!  I look forward to embarking on my new health journey with a doctor that genuinely cares about each patient.< /review>

A Doctor is an individual who demonstrates great knowledge and expertise in his/ her field of medicine and truly cares for individuals who are seeking treatment or ailment. I met Dr. Bron yesterday for the first time as my husband who is also being treated by him is very fond of him and highly recommends Dr.Bron. Dr.Bron was not only exactly what my husband said he would be, but more ! He was very personable and genuine. Highly knowledgeable, sympathetic and took time to explain my specific situation. He was able to pinpoint my exact pain points and treated those areas. I myself am a health care practitioner and I noticed Dr.Bron was very “in tune” and watching me to make sure I was comfortable during the procedure. It’s only been a day and I can already feel the difference! I love that his approach is from a Holistic standpoint. I will be referring friends and patients to him as he is one of a kind! Thank you Dr. Bron for your genuine kindness, compassions and expertise.<//Review>

I love this Doctor and his staff! I went here after my friend told me to go to Dr. Bronner for 4 yrs! Wish I would have went sooner.  Well trained staff, professional and friendly. Dr. Bronner is very personable and cares enough to figure out how to get you feeling your best.  Highly recommend him...</text>

I am very thankful to have the opportunity to work with a doctor who has such skill, talent, diligence and compassion. I knew he was the right doctor for me based on my research and all of the raving reviews. I can easily see why! I truly appreciate his deep level of knowledge and also his compassion. After just my first appointment, I am relieved knowing I am in the best hands. He takes the time to really understand the entire picture and approach it in a methodical way. He truly wants his patients to not only feel better, but to reach optimal health and feel better than they have in their entire lives. I left feeling better than when I came in. I cannot thank Dr. Bronner enough!</review>

Staff: Informative, efficient, caring. Doctor: Takes the time, really works to understand all the pieces of the puzzle of the health issues I have been experiencing.  I loved that they were able to do both my initial consultation and blood work in the same day. I have found that other Functional/Natural doctors send you to a lab to have all the blood work done which is just another appointment I don't have the time for.  Although my appointment for the follow up consult is still 30 days out they are SO AWESOME and call as each individual test come back to give me the details/results. THEN they will even ship the necessary supplements or call in prescriptions as needed. Absolutely fantastic!</review>

<review>Dr Bronner H. is terrific resource, very intelligent and exceptionally well informed on  "stay healthy" medical advice.  I always learn stuff when I spend time with Dr Bron and I know that I am much healthier than most people because I use him as my primary doctor and consultant.  Not sure what I would do without him.  Thanks Bron.  You are awesome!</review></record>

Dr Leslie Black is an absolute gem.  I am in my 5th decade and I have never had another doctor spend the time to review my condition, test results and treatment.   She is very knowledgeable, but explains things so I can understand and makes sure I have a full understanding.   She is a true asset to Dr Bonner’s practice and the medical field.< /Text>

Thank you for explaining my Lab results thoroughly. It was much appreciated to have a conversation with Doctor Bronner Handwerger. It made me feel that he cares about his patients and their health and you are not just a number. These qualities are rare in a Doctor, I am happy I found Dr. Bronner who takes pride in helping his patients regain their health!
On the road to being both physically and mentally fit!<//Review>

Hard to find any Doctor with the Skill Set and Passion delivered by Doctor Bronner and his team.  I was under his care for the HCG program and lost 51 pounds in 49 days.  His staff's attention to detail and success is unparalleled.  A pleasure/privilege to be a patient of this clinic - Thank You!< /text>

<Text>I have been seeing Dr. Bronner for many, many years, and it is always a pleasure to have an appointment with him.  I am in pretty good health, but I see Dr. Bronner at least once a year to go over my blood work and any other complaints/issues I might have on my mind at the time. He always has great recommendations for me!</Text>< rating>

< Review>
I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism since 2008. For years, I have been doing well with my medication - until about 1.5 years ago - I felt a change. However, after multiple visits to doctor's office, I was told that "everything was fine" since I was within the TSH level ranges. But I felt anything but "fine". The exhaustion, discomfort, depression, lack of energy, motivation or will to do anything...the list just goes on. Until I found Dr. Bronner H. and literally got my life back! He is empathetic, compassionate, knowledgeable and takes you seriously. I recommend Dr. Bronner to all of my friends, if they need a doctor. THANK YOU!<//Review>

Nothing I look forward to more than an hour with Dr. Bronner, he has made a bigger impact on my life than I think he will ever know.  Dr. Boaz has been incredible working on my foot.  After battling this injury for 13 months 4 treatments with him has it almost fully gone.  They really are the best in the business!<//text>

Knows things that no one else has ever figured out for me! He listens and thinks outside the box and isn't satisfied until he has you on a track that works!!!

If you've actually done anything w your life, you've put miles on your mind and body.. just like your favorite car, etc. This would be the only mechanic you'd want working on your favorite car..

Like Buffet says, you only get one body..

You should see this Doctor at least once in your lifetime.. put him on your bucket list, slide something else down.. you're probably not gonna get to Everest before it melts anyhow.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc06ce6f577ba9:0x281a0ab9e00b423e</gmap_id></record>

<Text>Dr. Bronner's holistic approach to resolving my symptoms is a refreshing experience.  He is attentive, a considerate listener, asked a lot of questions and he offered a variety of solutions (some at no financial benefit to himself). I really appreciate such an approach and I will be recommending my family, patients and friends to him.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I think I have written a half dozen reviews for Dr. Bronner but it can't be said enough how wonderful he is. Even if the news is less the optimal, he has a great delivery and always makes you feel cared for. The medical world would be a much better place if every Doctor was like him, but I guess thats why he is one in a million. If you have not seen him, give yourself a gift and go see him. When every other Doctor says " I don't know" or treats you like a number, you will know why I wrote this review. He is the best of the best.<//Review>

I've been a patient for a couple of years now, and Doc Bron has helped me with my fairly complex problems where other doctors and naturopaths failed. He has given me back my energy, and now he's going to help me get back the rest of my life. Priceless. You can discuss anything with Doc Bron without fear of judgment or embarrassment. My only regret is that I didn't find him sooner.</review>

Dr. Bronner is amazingly compassionate, highly trained and gifted in the wellness of the whole body.  His team is very kind and helpful too.  We are so thankful we found them as we have spend years searching to find a solution for our daughter's G. I. and celiac disease health issues.</Review>

Dr. Bronner took the time to really listen to all my issues and he took everything I said seriously.  Even things I didn't think mattered he saw as part of the bigger picture.  I also brought my son in and Dr Bronner explained things in a way that he could process and understand.  I love how he is not an all or nothing doctor.   He makes changes that are doable and works with you.  I'm new there but am looking forward to my son and I feeling better soon.< /text>

<Text>It is always a good experience seeing Dr. Handwerger.  I was skeptical about seeing another naturopathic doctor because of bad experiences I had had in the past in which every single one of them looks at every single patient that comes through the door and they get the "you have Candida" diagnosis.  How can 100% of a doctor's patients have the same diagnosis?  None of that bullshit, snake oil, sell you $500 worth of his supplements every month, with Doc Bron.  A real, honest-to-goodness, holistic approach, in which he listens and gives you no-nonsense feedback with humor and compassion.  I love it.  His staff is great too.  Very with it, kind, and on the ball.  They always follow up.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dc06ce6f577ba9:0x281a0ab9e00b423e</gmap_id>< Rating>

Dr. Bronner is an excellent naturepathic doctor.  He is also very skilled with anti-aging protocols both medical and aesthetic.  The office staff are knowledgeable and helpful and I was pleased with my recent experience at all levels at the clinic.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>We've chosen Dr. Bronner to assist us in our health care for more than 10 years. We travel a considerable distance to avail ourselves of his vast knowledge and expertise. We have not discarded our primary care physicians' help and services in any way!  As their name, "Integrative Health Solutions" implies, Dr. Bronner and I.H.S. help us to integrate our 'traditional" healthcare with ideas and information that are seldom, if ever discussed in HMO/PPO office visits. Dr. Bronner and his wonderful staff make the traditional "doctor visit" a thing of the past...each visit is a learning experience! After all, each one of us is, ultimately, responsible for maintaining our own healthcare.

As we enter our 7th decade of life, it is more important for us now, than ever before, to keep abreast of the latest nutritional breakthroughs and "healthful" lifestyle alternatives. In this quest, it is our opinion that Dr. Bronner has no rival.

We are grateful that Integrative Health Solutions continues to help us understand, maintain and improve our physical and mental acuity with each visit. We cannot recommend I.H.S.higher.

Thanks Doc!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dc06ce6f577ba9:0x281a0ab9e00b423e< /gmap_id></record>

<text>Dr. Bronner is one of a kind and treats each and every one of his patients the same way. He strives to find a solution for every problem whether it be through conventional or naturopathic means. He is simpley the best of East meets West. Morover he is extremely personable and engaging and you feel as though you are a part of his family after your very first visit. His staff follows his lead and are all very friendly, compassionate and engaging.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Dr. Bronner Handwerger represents the best example of physical care and emotional support.
He is a truce credit to his profession, a phenomenal listener, and an amazing guidance counselor to long term health and happiness. I went to see him for weight loss, and I quickly learned there was much more to be gained from his help and caring ways. I sent my son to see him for his anxiety issued and to rid him of the meds prescribed but lazy and un-caring doctors.
Today my son is a happy, healthy, and better because of Dr. Bronner's caring guidance and diligent diagnosis of what turned our to be vitamin and mineral deficiencies that did not require him to be drugged with mind altering anti-depressants.
The world needs more caring and competent Physicians and professional like Dr. Bronner.
My family and I are greatful for his care and assistance; and truly consider him a friend of the family. God bless Dr. Bronner and all of the fine folks at Integrative Health Solutions!< /review>

It was such a pleasant surprise to be greeted cheerfully at a post office, especially when it’s 15 minutes before closing. The two women working at the counter couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful and they did so while keeping the end of the day rush of customers moving through the line faster than I’ve ever seen at a post office.</Review>

We've lived in the neighborhood for 25 years.
I respect what the USPS does.
But this branch is just abysmal.
Waited 45 minutes in line, no exaggeration. 20 minutes in, 2 of the 3 counter workers went to lunch/on break.
Tried to get a PO Box. Elaine did not know what an insurance card was, which is one the acceptable forms of ID listed. She could not find my last name on my drivers license - my name is so long it's on 2 lines. She then argued with me about my name.
Ultimately, no PO Box for me here. I'll find another location, which is probably healthier for me anyway at this point.<//review><time>1597089682357</time><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rating>

I love my local post office.  I mail things via certified mail a lot and have nodding acquaintances with the postal clerks here.  I have never had anythng but professional and pleasant service from any of them.  And their jobs have got to be as difficult as the ones at the DMV. (Where I have gotten the worst customer service EVER)< /Text>

<text>I was away for a while, went in to pay up on my PO Box that went one month overdue, made new reservation for 3 months online like they told me to because they can only ring up 6 month or 9 month PO Box rentals, so I asked them to close that rental and I wanted to pay for a month I owed them.  Then I asked them to let my new contract run concurrent since they didn’t sell the 3 month product.  They outright refused me the same box number though it’s not a policy. I wanted to pay for the month and then run my new contract concurrent, bu my they refused my payment and Attempted to deny me my old same number back. After multiple calls and discussion with an upper level supervisor and two incredibly frustrating visits I have the same box number.  It’s not a written policy the USPS won’t allow a customer to run contracts back to back with the same  PO Box.  It’s not okay to create policy on a whim.</text>< pictures>

<text>Fast service no problems

Read some of the earlier reviews about the staff. Old Asian lady who regularly serves me is a nice person. She helped locate a missing parcel to another address by checking her internal system. Sender incorrectly wrote house number. She then advised to try calling on the door rather than wait for it to turn around. Good tip and got parcel right away! Agree she speaks rather loud but what’s wrong with that? Don’t we all have flaws in ourselves? Have dealt with other staff and they were equally nice. Not sure where the poor comments are coming from.<//text>< pics>

I'm a coffee roaster with subscription coffee box that I ship online. Geary USPS employees are basically my full-time employees and they are amazing. out of thousands of packages I've sent out, maybe 2 have been lost. they're always friendly. They're always sweet. I watch patrons belittle USPS employees regularly.<//Text>

The worst worst worst station ever. If I could send a audio or video review I would be screaming the whole time. This one delivery guy always is late and then lies about him coming to  your house.  He doesn't show up and he doesn't leave pink slips and then lies about it by putting on the tracking system that he comes right before final collection (5pm). He always does this. People like this destroy trust. And not to mention he talks like a complete idiot. I'm going to find out his name and talk to his supervisor to advise them to FIRE him and permanently ban him from delivery services across the world.<//Text>

20min later another post office employee found my letter. Thanks God!<//Text>< Name>

I had gotten a slip to say they attempted to deliver it on a Tuesday, was a very important package from my parents from abroad, i went in the first time and was told it wasn’t in the post office, i returned with a picture of the sent receipt and a picture of the package and they had attempted to tell me the package wasnt there again, not untill i kicked up a fuss and showed her what the package actually looked like did i recieve my package, I am exceptionally irritated by their lack of care for peoples packages and lack of effort and organization in place to ensure people receive their packages, i highly recommended a review of the working orders in this UPS, utterly disappointed!<//text>

Lost 3 of my packages and will not answer phone. I bet they steal our packages and sell them on the black market or something. I wish I could call the police because I consider this theft! How dare they be paid for such awful customer service. I intend to do something about this. Fair warning.<//review>

<Review>USPS needs to just go away!
They have absolutely no accountability for being abusive to your delivery.  If they "lose" your package they don't care in the slightest.  Our mail walker intentionally smashes letters into our boxes and knows full well there isn't anything anyone can do about it.  Doesn't deliver packages because he just doesn't want to and says nobody was home, causing packages that were paid to be same day to be over paid week long fights.

We have these guys on camera doing this.  I'm not just some hater, the overwhelming proof on VIDEO should be enough to make them change their ways... but they live in a country that makes their company invincible to consequences.

I'm not asking for improvement anymore, usps needs to just go away.  They need to hand in our key and just wither away like any other company would do if they displayed half of the malice towards their source of income.<//Review>< user_name>

<Text>This office has failed to re-deliver two important packages for me after missing a first delivery attempt. One was a Christmas present for me that was apparently stolen by employees or thrown away; it wasn't returned to sender. The second was expensive medication refilled online through Walgreens; after calling to set up redelivery, the package now has said "Out For Delivery" for a week, but no delivery attempts are made; this one seems to be lost too.

Why is re-delivery apparently broken at this USPS branch? This needs to be fixed.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Worst customer service I've ever had. They should fire all the staff and replace them with people who actually appreciate having that job. If I bring my business there, I'm helping with their paycheck. The people there are very difficult to work with, speak little english, try to rush you out the door, and cant seem to explain anything clearly. I loath this particular post office.< /Text>

<text>I'm not sure what the problem with this PO is. Speed is problematic,  but that's part for all of them. Same for UPS and Fedex, and they can cost more. I sell on ebay, and they've always handled my packages fine. What I don't like are the affiliate usps, like those at Staples. If it's complicated, they don't seem to do as well<//text>< pics>

Avoid avoid avoid. Prime example why USPS is going under/cant break even.
Called a dozen times, and it rang and rang and rang. I was not going away since they lost my package yet marked it delivered. Finally, someone picked up.

I started to talk and had not yet explained ANY of my question when she said "what? hold on let me transfer you." I said "wait wait wait! dont transfer me!" desperate to talk to the person I had gotten on the phone. Instead, she ignored my comments and put me on hold, where I've been holding for half an hour now.

Hope they get laid off. Waste of tax payer money.<//text>

My experience here sucks!  lady mess up and send my package to Gabon-Africa instead of the place I wrote on the paper and box. Of course, its been over a month and the box is missing. I found out because in the receipt that she print says Gabon-firstclass. When I went to ask her she told me I should have check right away where she was issuing my package! So I should have check the receipt she print for me? I didnt know its my responsability to check for their mistakes.  LOST my money LOST my package because their mistake and they dont want to be responsable for anything.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><review>Very good vista point to finish your hike. I started from the Stevens Creek County Park side and then found my way here. For me it was about 9+ miles. You can get to it from Regnart road, you have a very steep start and then you go left and reach this spot. You can also get here from the Prospect parking lot, this route is lot less steep but much longer. Either way once you get you have a bench to sit down and enjoy the valley views.</review><GmapID>0x808fb4eb7e673855:0xfe15b1d859506d39</GmapID><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1pa9rTlBy68Rh8TNH0Rfh8ktuvr6Q70UiOBnN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV_XtE8NSV4zSEG2whX8EyM7cTWVX1WtUefThb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeUGLc7gXi1qgklKNq2-icUUvEOtpR6NPwJ9f6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMX4nZjU21ygxnIqhSaWS--2gZ6nhx8vu9SsP9-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Date>

Dogs on leash are allowed here too.Great place to see the sunrise. One of the highest points to view the bay area. There are multiple trail options to hike. Fremont older has limited parking spot, sometimes you may have to park on the street and walk to the trail head.< /review>< rating>

The best sunrise point in SF Bay Area 😍😍😍
You need to reach there very early in the morning. Parking spot is very limited and it gets full in no time. There is a limited road side parking options though😊

It’s very little hike and the reward is amazing. Good for friends and family and beginner.

One advice is please check the weather report before going there. Very often it gets cloudy and foggy there. So you may not get clear sunrise view. Please check my photos for the amazing sunrise view. I always go there only after checking clear weather report.< /Text>

great viewpoint close to cupertino to overlook the bay area! although steep, it's a pretty short hike from regnart road. you can also hike a bit farther to and from the fremont older open space reserve entrance, which has some nice views as well. :))< /Text>

A relatively easy hike (10-15 mins) - but it's rather steep on the way up. Stop by around sunset and watch the deer and rabbits head to bed!<//Review>

Great view from the top. Most of the hike is unshaded but it's nice and close to the Bay area. Even on a Saturday there weren't a ton of people. Parking was just on the side of the road. GPS didn't take us far enough so we drove a little further until we saw a few cars parked on the side next to one of the trail openings. It can be slightly steep in some areas but it's not an overly strenuous hike, esp since it's pretty short, like a couple miles</Text>

If the shortest hike to the one of the best viewpoints in the bay area is what you are looking for, then look no futher. A steep but quick 20 min ascent from Regnart road up the Regnart trail brings you panoramic views of the Bay area extending all the way to South San Francisco. Connects with a whole network of trails for all day hiking.< /Text>

<text>It's definitely a good hike. However it was rated one of the best Bay Area hikes for strollers.

It is not. Definitely a bit too challenging, even with the proper stroller.

I'd still do it again though. It was good for my fat ass!</text>< Pictures>

We’ve been coming here for many years. Good place for a quick hike close to home. I like the trails. The view of the valley from Hunter’s Point is spectacular.</review>

<Review>A great view and always lots of nice folks to chat with. It's also a dog meeting area, so that's a plus if you like dogs. You get a view all the way to Mofett field and toward Gilroy. It's a good place for ham radio contacts as well. There was a contact made with a guy in Hawaii using a 10 watt handheld radio from Hunter's Point.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fb4eb7e673855:0xfe15b1d859506d39<//Gmap_id><rating>5</rating>< Time>

Nice, less than 15 minute hike/walk to the top where you get a great view of the city (morning, afternoon, or night). It's not too crowded though you'll definitely see people around when you hike. There are multiple hiking trails around the area, some steeper than others. Overall it's not too hard of a hike, you might be a little tired on the uphill parts but there's areas of shade and it's not long enough to tire you out too bad.< /review>

Come up here and hang out for a while. You can see the Googleplex, Apples new headquarter construction site and Moffett Field.< /Text>< rating>

This is a wonderful, small, branch of the Sac. County Libraries. I waited a long "pandemic year" for it to re-open. Only allowed one hour on a PC and a maximum visit of only two hours. Tuesday thru Saturday open from 10Am to 6Pm. Facemask required. Out of 14 PC's only 3 are available with social distancing. A decent collection of DVDs to checkout.(not nearly as many as the Folsom Library though) They used to have all the periodicals, magazines, and newspapers that mattered but haven't seen any since the re-opening. Hope they'll extend time allowed soon, not much to be done with only one hour of computer or electrical outlet to recharge. Super friendly staff but all different from who'd been there for years before pandemic.< /text>

<Review>This Bibliotheca, is great. There actually are a large number of things to do for young people in the area to do. Tons of room to learn or study quitely in silence.
In addition to the loads of writings, there are other types of resources to aid you research or get your tasks completed. Printing solutions are offered, along with easy computers connected to the web.

Browse, print, or send out e-mails. With a range of within your reaches, there is plenty for you to get into right here. Just about every neighborhood needs to have such a valuable and lovely resource readily available to individuals who live there. It is an embarassment that as a result of lack of unique financing, several are required to cutback, or fold. Make sure you promote your public library as much as you can, as these important resouces need all they can get, and are going away at a rapid pace.

When I was a child, I would certainly invest hrs on end, studying, playing, as well as studying. The improvement of modern technologies has actually permitted us to execute several activities convenitely in our residences, however there are still many actions you can not due without your local library. Most individuals will not miss them till they are gone, but once they are gone, it's almost impossible to get them back. Cherrish your library and battle to keep its pressence in your city. Support your public library.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

If you ever need something to read. RC public library is a good option. Good selection of choices, and computer access if needed, also very helpful staff. Convenient location. 5 star worthy? Check!< /Text>

My kids love going to story time but the last two weeks the library has been closed, at least it has on Wednesday's. Once for scheduled maintenance, one not. Going to have to start calling before getting my kids excited only to be disappointed.<//Text>

<review>I'm giving this library a very poor rating because I felt discriminated against & not assisted. Almost every time my son tries to play on the kids touch screen computer, they tell us he is not allowed to clime the chair and touch the screen. Instead of trying to compensate for his shortness they told me I wasn't slowed to move the screen closer to the chair for him to be able to touch the screen standing up. I called the district lady and never heard back. Just because my son is short does not mean he should not be allowed to play with the equipment that's meant for his age group...</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I would give five stars once they update their book check out. It’s outdated and not self service. It would make everything run smoother and faster.< /Review>

Attended a blogger meeting in the community room at the library. The room is warm, bright and has all the technology needed for presentations and movies. The blogging group is great! Very professional and friendly.</Review>

This is not a quiet place at all. Even the staff are part of making the noise. They designed the library in such away that if a person is talking in one corner, it is heard in another.< /Text>

I love this place and would live in it, even though I have only been there a few times. This is coming from a girl who can consume ~20 400-500 paged books within 1 or 2 weeks. I CRAVE teen books, and thankfully they have a huge teen section. But they also have a good kids section, as well as a nice adult and research section. All the liberarians are welcoming and accomidating. There is a comfortable seating section, and plenty of computers free to use. The atmosphere is calming and peaceful. Even though there are people talking, it is a pleseant aura.<//Text>

Great place to spend time with kids. If you get a chance to go to a booksale, you could fill a grocery paper bag full of very interesting books for a ver cheap price! Enjoy reading!< /Text>

We love this library! We went to story time for the first time today and attended the Yisrael garden, he's very knowledgable about gardening and he's really good with the kids. All the kids were so engaged and curious and learned new facts and maybe peaked more interest and an appreciation for our fruits and vegetables. This library is great for kids all ages.< /Text>

I’ve been a patient at this practice for about 15 years. I see both Dr Matiasevich and Dr Chai, and my dental hygienist is Anna. I love them all and have gotten great care over the years. They have always handled my insurance and billing concerns accurately. It’s always a pleasant visit.< /Text>

I’m new to the area and my coworkers recommended this dentist. I was in the excellent care of delightful Jenny, and “Dr. Bob” had a refreshing balance of professionalism and personality. Always a relief to have a solid hygienist and dentist. This is my new place. 5 stars all day long.<//text>

I had just made an appointment for him at his eye doctor and family physicial that same day and have for 20 years plus everywhere.

When I became upset with them they decided that I was not someone they had time to talk to and would not talk to because I was upset and raised my voice. I did my research both online and with Blue Cross representative  who said it is not a Hipaa violation to make an appointment for my spouse as long as there are no confidential discussions.

I asked to speak to the owner Dr. M. and was told they would leave a message to have him call me. Have not heard from him yet.

I even explained to them that there is nothing confidential about picking out a time and day for my husband's appointment.

Front office people are so crucial to the sucess of a doctors office success. We sadly will not be going back to this establishment.<//text><pics>None< /pics><time>1610506547497<//time>< rating>

Immediately they offer the most expensive treatment!i paid  300$ Just to be told that I can’t afford the treatment? Free consultation like promise in the website ??

<Review>If I could have it my way I would only have Anna as my dental hygienist.  You feel her warmth from all the attention she gives you.  The welcoming smile to greet you with, welcoming ears to listen with and gentle touch while cleaning your teeth.  Anna treats you as a family member.  When she is done cleaning my teeth I could actually feel the difference on the surface of the teeth.  My teeth are clean and smooth.  She actually removes the plaque off my teeth.  I had my teeth cleaned many times and she was the first person that I felt actually knew what she was doing.  These are some reasons out of many more reasons why I return to Dr. Matiasevich and Dr. Chai at Santa Cruz Family Dentist .< /Review><user_id>112709049329777573724< /user_id><gmapID>0x808e3fe4d4d0fd5f:0x10abe9e14e868853</gmapID></record>

<Text>No one really likes going to the dentist but it’s a fact of life. I personally used to have anxiety attacks and just refused to go. Until I started going to  see Dr Matiasevich .  He has such compassion and care for his patients.  He listens and understand his patients needs and wants and goes above and beyond to make that happen.  His staff members are very warm and welcoming as well. I would definitely recommend Dr Bob to anyone for any dental service.<//Text>< Date>

Since moving to Dr. Robert Matiasevich’s dental office I have received only excellent care. Jenny who cleaned my teeth yesterday was the perfect example; a combination of a highly trained professional and a thoughtful, gentle and responsive person. I refer anyone I hear looking for a new dentist to this office without reservation.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Charged $295 to extract a tooth that took less then 10 mins. After we left his office my wife let me know he was more concerned about hurrying up then patient care and actually yelled at her to not move even thou he was hurting her more. She was smart to informing me after we left. Our regular Dentist over the hill, who unfortunately was out of the state would have charged $79 and used a smaller needle to inject the medications, instead of the pencil sized needle.
SO Over priced, and terrible bedside manners.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Wonderful office, staff and of course dentist!  From the minute you walk in the door everything is friendly and well organized. Dr Bob’s stuff is extremely competent and because the latest technology in record keeping and treatment is employed you know you are getting the best care. Then there is Dr Bob. Such a great person on top of being an excellent practitioner. I felt very well cared for in his hands and I loved his non aggressive yet comprehensive approach to treating my condition. Wonderful practice and people!< /Review><user_id>115465866326168018383<//user_id>< Response>

<name>Lucille Nordgren</name><text>I love all the people in this office.  From my first visit, the ladies in the office have remembered my name and welcome me warmly each time I walk in.  I like the fact that all the corrective work is summarized at the beginning along with the cost, so that I know I will end up with healthy teeth and gums.and can arrange for a payment plan.  And then, there is "Mr. Wonderful"...Mitchell!, ...who has been a friend from the beginning, working with insurance and payment options.  Dr. Matiasevich is also very friendly and gentle and the treatment so far has been quick and painless.  I feel that I have made a good decision to entrust my dental care to this office.</text>< resp>

I really am very happy with Dr. Bob and his staff.  I feel that he and his staff are very customer friendly and every time I go to my appointments, I get their undivided attention.  Also, if I have questions, I always get an answer.  If I don't at the appointment, I can call Mitchell and he will push thru my questions and they staff will remember to mention it at my next appointment or I will get a phone call.  I feel very comfortable with the whole staff.  Its been a joy having my dentist tell me, I'm doing a "great job" keeping my teeth in great health!
Thanks a bunch!<//Text>

<Review>I REALLY admire the efficiency and outstanding professionalism of Santa Cruz Family Dentistry.
I’m very relieved, because even though the wonderfully able Dr Chai had to work for 5 (!) hours filling cavities and root-canalling one tooth, I’m all fully repaired by now. (I’d come from another dentist who was so disorganized he ignored info on my cavities so I’ve lost two teeth, one that’s been replaced! Make sure there’s follow-up to your teeth cleaner’s assessment, otherwise cavities don’t get fixed on time! I’m so glad a good friend referred me to this first-class dentistry!!!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Coming from someone with a dental phobia this has been the best dental experience ever. Today I went in to get work done with Dr. Chai. She was beyond amazing. She really made sure I was comfortable throughout my appointment. I even got a cozy blanket! After my treatment with the doctor I had a cleaning. The hygienist Anna not only left my teeth feeling clean but really took the time to get to know me. I would definitely recommend this dynamic duo to anyone looking for a dentist!<//review>

<review>Dr. Robert Matiasevich is kind and knowledgeable. He did implant surgery on me to replace some missing teeth. Perfect! Everyone at his practice is highly trained and polite. His office is state of the art and always spotless.
I was referred to him after my previous dentist failed to diagnose a problem that cost me a tooth. I had told my him of pain when I flossed a certain tooth. He took an x-ray and said the tooth was fine and not to worry. I told him again at my next 4 appointment but he said the same thing. After 2 years the tooth was infected so he referred me to an oral surgeon who took a deeper x-ray and said we had to pull it. I was not happy about it
I  am very happy with Dr. Matiasevich.<//review></record>

Dr Matiasevich is outstanding; smart, talented, empathetic, kind and generous! Can not say enough good things about this wonderful dentist and his staff. They are the best that you could ever hope for in a dental office. Amazing that they help local people on MediCal too.</Review>

<Time>1568915989878<//Time><rate>1< /rate><Text>I am an older woman who is on disability because of MS and two other chronic diseases. My teeth are in horrible shape and I am embarrassed of them every time I smile. I was able to see Dr bob a few times for severely abscessed teeth. I got treatment and it was good treatment I must say. However, I am not by any means able to get all the work done that is needed. I would give anything to be able to smile again and eat certain foods.
Yesterday, I received a certified letter from this office saying they were deactivating my chart and to find another dentist. They said they had tried to notify me via phone calls, emails and regular mail for biannual cleanings. I received nothing from them. First of all, I can’t afford biannual cleanings and second of all, if they attempted to clean my teeth, they would break. Yes it’s that bad. I suffer embarrassment on a daily basis because of my horrible smile and then to actually get fired by a doctor was awful. I was comfortable in the fact that if my face blew up again because of another abscess, dr bob would help me. Nope, not happening. I was fired as a patient.  Anyways done ranting.  But I really think this sucks.< /Text>< pics>

Excellent  dentist and staff!
Dr. Bob is highly skilled and very personable.
I am very particular about my dentists and my needs are not typical.
I really appreciate that this office provides a wide range of quality and caring dental services.
I am forever grateful that I found this kind of professionalism in my own back yard!

Due to rough dental experiences in my youth, I have become a "white knuckle" patient.
A co-worker recommended Dr. Matiasevich Sr to me, many years ago.  What a wonderful man…caring and gentle.
When he retired, Dr. Bob Jr took over the practice and he was just as caring and gentle as his father.  I especially like the fact that he takes the time to explain any procedures he will do, and is aware that I am very sensitive to dental work.
Another thing:  All the dental hygienists that I have used in this office, are wonderful.  They, too, explain the procedures as we go along, and I love the little 'goody bag' they give out when the work is done.
I have recommended Dr. Bob Jr to many people.  He is truly a fine representative of what a good dentist should be.<//Text>

<review>Wonderful from start to finish: front office is very welcoming and makes a point of getting to know you. Leslie, the hygienist who worked on me, was very educational about teeth care and worked with what I was familiar with, as well as recommend other products (but wasn't pushy about needing to get them). I liked her approach of "let's work on setting up a good home-care procedure vs. going straight to deep cleaning or work." Dr. Bob was great and gave me good recommendations/feedback on my teeth.
The office obviously realizes that people are a bit afraid of the dentist, so they work to make you feel comfortable all the way through. I love their menu options while your teeth are being cleaned - you get the option of lavender pillows, music, sunglasses (talk about extra comfort!).
Glad I found this dentist's office and look forward to making this team a part of my regular dental care.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Would not recommend. I was told it would take 3 to 5 months. 15 months later still don’t fit like they should.
Been back 5 or 6 times still they don’t fit. I can’t even use my implants. I’m going to some body else, to finish the job. It will be interesting what the new guys going to say about the work I have had done.< /Text>

I came to Dr. Matiasevich mid a dental procedure. I had been to several other dentists that weren't sure how or even if they could complete it for me. Dr. Matiasevich was completely confident that he could complete it for me. He not only proved his confidence but gave me choices that best suited me. Also, the two dental assistants (hope that's the correct title) that have worked with me made each step of the procedures easy and comfortable. I would recommend his practice for anyone that enjoys working with competent professionals.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Matiasevich is amazing. Unlike every other dentist I've ever been to,  he was mindful of my sensitivity to drugs and he removed two of my teeth using gas instead. I had absolutely no pain during the procedure and very little afterword.

For some time now I have been procrastinating getting an implant, actually two implants.  I have heard the entire process is very painful.  After researching a number of dental offices, I was referred to Dr. Matiasevich Jr. DDS.  My initial consultation with Dr. Bob confirmed that I had made an excellent decision.  He sat me down, we reviewed 3D x-rays,  and explained the entire procedure...and to my surprise he also took the time to evaluate all my teeth.  Not once did I feel that they were trying to push more work.  I was impressed with their internal communication and follow up after the procedure.  I honestly can go on and on about little details that stood out and impressed me.  It was nice to feel they genuinely cared about how I was feeling.  My implant was a total success and I highly recommend Dr. Bob.  Look no further...best dentist I have ever been to.  Unfortunately, I will be back for another implant.  :)< /Review>

<Text>I needed to establish myself with a practice in Santa Cruz, and a co-worker recommended Dr. Matiasevich Jr. I was very impressed with all aspects of my visit. The technicians were honest, thorough, skilled, and eager to educate. I was provided with literature supporting all I was told. Dr. Matiasevich was calm, engaging and did great work. I had a few fillings done, and had no discomfort. I would highly recommend Dr. Matiasevich to anyone.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Dr. Bob is a good dentist. He put in a crown after a tooth cracked and took his time to make sure that it fit properly and that my bite was correct. Leslie is my favorite all-time hygienist. Everyone is friendly and I haven't had to wait long for an appointment or to see the the dentist or hygienist when I'm there. They work with my insurance so that my dental bills are relatively small.<//Review>< Pictures>

I am so mad at Dr Matissevich, he talked my 84yr old mother,  Congestive Heart Failure  getting close to hospice, to rip out all of her teeth and get dentures that he said she would "snap" right in. Long story short he charged her, her last $ 9,000.00 to live her last year in pain and embarrassed that she had no teeth and the dentures did not work, not even close, no snapping in to the post!  She died 18 months after he removed all her teeth. I was unable to be here to advocate for her, she trusted him and believed he would delivery what he promised, dentures that were more like posts then dentures?  I wish he would have talked to her about her medical condition and helped her enjoy her last months,  keeping her teeth as best he could. Her retired dentist would have. He is out for money only. The follow up was horrible with her trying to get the dentures to work.  Sad story.<//Text>

<Text>I have severe dental anxiety and fear to the point I would just avoid the dentist for years. I had read about Dr. Bob and how he and his team work with and understand dental anxiety. So being I really needed to go I decided to give him a shot. Absolutely fantastic although I did still have an anxiety melt down, him and his team understood, didn't push and helped me get through it. Ive been a dental patient for over 2 years now and go regularly for cleanings and check-ups. I still get anxiety but each time it gets a little less stressful for me. The staff is extremely friendly from the front desk to the back office. I've never had a bad experience there. I can say I love my dentist even if I don't love the dentist 😉 thank you Dr. Bob, Dr. Chen and staff. You make it a better experience<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Excellent service always on time. I appreciate that everything is kept on schedule.  The teeth cleaning was very professional and thorough. I got some good advice on my dental care.  I also received some good supporting products  to assist with my  personal dental care.< /review>

Office staff very friendly and nice to deal with.  Always helpful and cheerful, seem to be happy where they are working.
Anna, my hygienist, has been cleaning my teeth for years.  She is very good at her job and very pleasant to be around during the visit.  Really enjoy my appointments with her.  She is the best.< /Text>

I have been seeing Dr. Matiasevich for many years. Currently, I am seeing Leslie on the Hygiene staff and I find her to be very thorough and caring.  She is always thorough and professional while being friendly and war.  Her work is excellent and she is committed to her profession.  I look forward to seeing Leslie for a long time to come.<//text>

Had extensive work with excellent results.  No pain with very invasive  procedures.   Kind kind people who addressed irrational fears and we're never judgemental.  If you have skipped the dentist because of bad experiences,  Dr. Choi can help you.< /Review>

I've been in only a few times now, but each time the staff and service have been prompt, pleasant, easy to work with and really on the ball.  Treatments have been very professional, my complicated payment scenario was made super smooth, consultations have been thorough, and results from the work have exceeded expectations.  My mouth is really a mess and its great to have found a place where they seemingly do it all in house and work very well together and with me.< /review>

<Review>Dr. Bob is a true professional and always gets down to business. I am pleased with his services especially because his office knows how to bill Medicare for health related dental services.  I found his office through a special flyer I received at my home and was willing to drive 35 miles to get his services.  Thank you for the opportunity to submit my review.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>I was so nervous to go in and have my root canal done, but Dr. Chai was extremely comforting and she walked me through everything. I was so afraid of feeling it, but I was SO happy that I didn’t feel a thing! It was 100% painless. I felt relaxed and at ease the entire time. I highly recommend going to see Dr. Chai if you’re in need of some dental work. I am so grateful for her and her team for taking care of me!</text><Date>1548354640482</Date>< Response>

<text>I have been a Dr. Matiasevitch patient for many years and it's because of his exceptional and thorough work, I continue to choose him as my dental health professional. He makes his state of the art practice based on the most current science-based practice of dentistry a priority for his office.  His pain-free and accurate procedures are a blessing along with his exceptional personal touch in making the dental visit a great experience.    Dr Matiasevitch is the "dentist's dentist" and I am so grateful he is in our community!<//text></record>

My husband and I have known Dr. Bob for about 4 years now. We were referred by one of Dr. Bob's staff that used to see my husband (Chiropractor Justin McLeod). We just recently had some work done, and we so appreciate their work. Thank you again Dr. Bob and Staff!<//review>< pictures>

According to a recent compliant you called for the cost of a procedure and were angered by the front office not being able to diagnose your condition over the phone.  I would be curious to see if physcians, nurses and front office medical personal in your field give treatment quotes over the phone?\n3.  I would venture to say you have never undergone conscious sedation in our office.  Hard for you to comment on its delivery.\n4.  Our office has been in Santa Cruz for over 45 years.  I have been practicing in the current location for 22 years.  The first time the office was remodeled was November 2018- January 2019.\nIt appears the only truth you are capable of is making good on your letters claim to disparage us with non-truths on social media.\nThank you so much for changing providers.'}</resp>

<text>My husband and I have gone to this office for over 20 years and the last two years things have gone steadily downhill. The new employees are inexperienced in both customer service, calls me hon and can't find my chart, then lies about it, and general medicine and terminology.  These employees can give conscious sedation and it would be a nightmare if something would happen, which as a nurse, things happen. They could not give me an idea of cost until I was out of the chair and then it took a second, but because I was asking, I was treated as a second class citizen.  They seem to only be interested in the money and redecorating their office for the 4th time. Cold and distant in everything.< /text>< Time>

<text>My husband and I have gone to this office for over 20 years and the last two years things have gone steadily downhill. The new employees are inexperienced in both customer service, calls me hon and can't find my chart, then lies about it, and general medicine and terminology.  These employees can give conscious sedation and it would be a nightmare if something would happen, which as a nurse, things happen. They could not give me an idea of cost until I was out of the chair and then it took a second, but because I was asking, I was treated as a second class citizen.  They seem to only be interested in the money and redecorating their office for the 4th time. Cold and distant in everything.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I am 77 years old and have been seeing this dentist for the past 8 years.  I have had some bad experiences in the past with dentists and was missing most of my back teeth.  I struggled with dentures for a while.  Dr. Bob tried for years to talk me into implants.  Last year I finally decided to take him up on the idea.  He sedated me for the appointment and I did not feel anything.  Afterwards there was no pain and and I had brand new teeth in the back of my mouth.  They work great and I wish I would have done it sooner.  They are just like real teeth.  Everyone who works here including the gal who lectures me while cleaning my teeth are so friendly.  You can't ask for a better dental office.< /Text>

Dr. Matiasevich is the finest dentist I have ever had the pleasure… yes, pleasure of meeting. The moment you walk in the door you can clearly see the caring and respect for his patients evident in everything from the wonderful people working the front office to the incredible talent and care of Dr. Matiasevich. A year ago, my fiancee and myself, moved from Santa Cruz over the hill to San Jose but we make the 45 minute to 1 hour drive back just to see Dr. Bob for all our regular dental care.<//Text>

The best dental care I have ever received! Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Everytime I have called, they fit me in right away. I see Dr. Chai and she is very sensitive to my hesitation and fear of dental work. I've had bad experiences in recent years and neglected regular check-ups as a result. Leslie did my cleaning and was wonderful too! If this had been my dental care team all along - I never would have missed an appointment. I brought my sons (2 and 4 years old) here and the dental assistant was awesome with them. The kids do not fear the dentist at all and are looking forward to their next appointment. I can not say enough good things about the entire staff  - they even took time off to do humanitarian work overseas as a staff. I feel good about giving my business to a place that cares about doing quality work, having a positive work environment, and gives back to less fortunate.< /review>

<review>I came in with a bad toothache and the good Dr. had to squeeze me in on a busy day. His staff was extremely polite and courteous, they went out of their way to help me feel comfortable.
He performed a root canal, which I had been dreading with absolute terror. Much like all my exes, my fear was completely irrational,  and I'm so glad I took care of it. Honestly, no pain, even when he had to use his needles. He was like a ninja, I didn't even notice him poking me.  Following the procedure I am pain free and eating my favorite crunchy foods again. Dr Bob earned a  Patient for life.</review>< Pictures>

I have had the best experiences here! When I first came to the office I was terrified of the dentist but after a year of visits, with sedation, I feel so comfortable with Dr. Chai now that I only request gas. Dr. Chai has done a lot of work to my teeth and she provides warmhearted care to her patients. The staff is friendly and professional. I appreciate everyone there from the first person you see when you walk through the door and the last person on the way out.  I would recommend this place to family, friends and I have actually referred coworkers.</Review>

<review>Our family has been going to Dr. Bob for over 15+ years. Like most people, going to the dentist is a chore & like pulling teeth (every pun intended :-) ).  In all seriousness, Dr. Bob makes the visit easy and literally painless.  I am a big chicken when it comes to pain.
He and his staffs are always pleasant and professional.  My husband and I had multiple crown replaced and it was a really a painless experience.

I actually enjoy getting my teeth cleaned because the hygienists are friendly and professional.  It's fun to get to know Ana, the hygienist; she is always friendly, approachable and you can talk to her about anything. She is thorough with your teeth cleaning.

Our sons like to go to Dr. Bob because he is just a fun person to be around and he makes jokes with them and relate to them with what is going on with their life at the time.   So they feel Dr. Bob cares about them beyond taking care of their teeth.

I understand Dr. Bob is always learning about new innovations and ideas to better serve his patients. I would want a dentist who are up to date with  the latest and greatest and the safest products and methods to use on patients.   I remember the first few times I went to him and needed my filling to be replaced and he noticed my previous dentist used filling with mercury in them! He was a little surprised to see it because mercury is so hazardous to your central and the peripheral nervous systems. Thanks to Dr. Bob, now my teeth is mercury-free. Thank you, Dr. Bob!

What I admire about Dr. Bob and his business practice is that he cares about the community where he lives in. He gives back by offering free dental care to the Veterans once a year.
I'm sure he does so much more for the community that we don't know about because he and his family are humble people and they serve the community quietly.

Walking into the office, the atmosphere is light and fun. The staffs greets you will a big smile and a happy tones.
I say "fun" because he always has product give-aways for patients who wants to participate in that season's game or competition in order to win.  The products are very practical and useful!

Overall, I think Dr. Bob is one of the best dentist in the Santa Cruz  County.  If you are "shopping" for a dentist, shop no more.  Give him a try and you will be smiling wider and more often because you will like the look of your teeth. :-)

and from that point on I believed that he could and he would restore my mouth.  Mitch has been absolutely on point with coordinating and facilitating the processing of my treatment.

<text>Went in for my first experience with Dr. Matiasevich and Team due to severe pain in one tooth. He diagnosed the problem very quickly and gave me the option of taking care of it right then. 1 root canal and a temporary crown later, I emerged about an hour later with no pain and a salvaged tooth structure. My Dad was an Oral Surgeon and I have been to many dentists over the years and I have to say I've never seen anybody more precise or fast than Dr. M. His manner was extremely professional yet personable and his skills are the best I've encountered in the 40+ years I've been going to dentists. I highly recommend his practice. Going to the dentist is not high on my list of favorite things in life but when I do go in, I value the confidence and results that this office delivers.</text>< userid>

<Text>My least favourite dentist ever, I would not recommend anyone to use this practise.  Dentist was  rude to his staff, inconsiderate, unprofessional and good for nothing. Patient care and treatment should come first but this is not the case. This practice is more about the money than a caring dental practice. Any person in the medical field should be full of care and compassion, they should put their patients care first. I had terrible cleaning with Anna, and was not treated with the dignity you would expect at a medical practice.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1448081561644, 'text': "We have a lot of great patients and realize that some may read this review and be perplexed since it doesn't describe any experience that have had with us.

<response>None< /response><Name>Jesse Munoz<//Name><Review>I'm anna, Jesse's wife, we've been going to Matiasevich's Dental Office since the 80's.
We started with Robert Sr.(now retired) and recently continued with Robert Jr.  Him and his staff are one of the best at what they do.  My husband tried other Dentists, because we lost our dental insurance.  And now Matiasevich is fixing what the other Dentists didn't do right.  The Staff has worked hard for us, contacting our dental insurance, on a weekly basis.  The staff did manage to bring down our amount owed.  So, thanks to the staff for their effort.  Our Dental insurance stinks, but is the only dental insurance we can afford.  I know, once Matiasevich finishes fixing the bad work the other dentists did on my husband.  We will only be paying for cleanings and regular checkups.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Best dental experience I've had in 48 yrs.  I'm 48 btw.  From the initial phone call to set the appt to the exam to the cleaning to the bill explanation for the treatment plan.  My dental procedure was executed with precision and flawless.  Dr. Chai actually called me directly later in the day to check on me leaving her cell phone # on my voice mail.  This has never happened to me before.  Top notch through and through.</Text>< pics>

< review>
Dr. Bob has been my dentist since we moved to Santa Cruz more than a decade ago. Yesterday afternoon while eating a particularly chewy granola, I lost an old crown that had been done well before I came here. I immediately picked up the phone and called the office. The kind and patient staff member listened to my whining and was able to get me right in to see the new dentist at the office, Dr. Chai. I love Dr. Bob and trust him implicitly and didn't think I would trust anyone else. Dr. Chai is quite pleasant and very meticulous. This is my second experience with her and  I will recommend her highly to any new patient. Dr. Chai efficiently assessed my tooth situation, quickly checked to see if they had time to complete the work right then, had the young man at the front office check my insurance coverage and the work was soon underway, I can never say enough about how wonderful the assistants are at this office. They always take very good care of me. When you are in that chair, you are at their mercy. Never for one moment have I felt anything but safe and secure. Thank you for the hugs and handholding. Are you guys getting tired of me singing your praises?< /review>

This visit was for x-rays to see how the inplants were doing.... to determine when the final procedure can be scheduled.  I have to say that this is the FIRST time EVER that the technician taking the x-ray listened to my explanation of pain caused by the x-ray card's pressure and placed  cotton on the bone...so there was NO PAIN!   FANTABULOUS!!  and once again, Treatment Coordinator, Mitchell Stelling, took time to discuss other matters and not only was understanding but willing to "work things out".... which wasn't necessary after all was "said & done".  He once again was delightful to work with.  I am so looking forward to my next appointment, which will be to finish the implant procedures and have molars once again with which to chew my food!   Yea!!!  Front desk personnel are also personable and accomodating!  I am delighted to be a patient patient!!      Happy New Year to all!< /Review>

<review>Amazing service. I didn’t go to the dentist for 6 years from a fear i had built up but was recommended to come to their office and it was one of the best decisions i have ever made. The staff is the best in the buisness hands down, its always a pleasant experience to go in there. They are all super friendly and realy look out for your needs and will always answer any  questions or concerns you may have.I usually get dr Chai and or Jenny ,they give me a smooth experience everytime they realy know their work amd i can tell they work hard i love that.I had alot of work done in my but after some time dr chai, jenny and the staff got me in one piece again thank you so much!:-)< /review><Rating>5</Rating><UserId.>108289258008787589397<//UserId.>< pics>

I think the Doctor is great and he does great work! I have not been back for some time only due to a receptionist working for him giving me a hard time trying to make an appt. she wanted me to put up a deposit before she would give me another appt.!! I am handicapped and was at the beginning of 7 long surgeries, I had to cancel two times and ONLY two times, she tried to say it had been four!! I had just been in to see him two weeks before! I am now going back in hopes that, that person is gone and I can enjoy the Drs. Work again!< /review>

I've known Dr. Bob Jr. for several years and had always made it known my family and I were'nt fans of going to the dentist. Past bad experiences for my children have been the main issue. So after alot of consulting and absoulutely no pressure from Dr. Bob Jr. we made appointments for all for of our children. I've made it no secret to Dr. Bob that our middle daughter (8yrs old) was traumatized by her last dentist showing her the needles she would be using. Well wouldn't you know she needed the most work , including a tooth pulled. The patience and understanding Dr. Bob and his staff showed my daughter (and myself as I paced in the waiting room) was awesome. He took the time to comfort her and explain every procedure. He waited for her to be ready and gave her breaks as she needed. We left with a better outlook on future visits and an appreciation for all the effort Dr. Bob Jr. and his put forth.<//Text>

< Review>
I was very nervous to have stage 1 of 2 new crown prep. I asked if I could take 1/2 Xanax - they said sure - when I got in the chair and taking my blood pressure - I was afraid my BP would be shooting up - but the awesome team talked to me. And then I got an iPod with lots of music choices - and sunglasses - and a special treatment to calm me even more. The greatest thing was they remembered me from my teeth cleaning - all the questions about me and my life - from the front desk to the Dentist - everyone knew my name - and I have never felt so special and cared for by a Dental Practice and the whole staff!! Always upbeat and ready to care for you!  Thank you Team Matiasevich!! Best Dental appt ever- I know I'm only 61 - but you showed me respect and concern!!! Thank You!!<//Review>

<Review>I went to this dentist needing a root canal, replacement and a possible deep cleaning. They wanted to charge me about $6000 for all of this. I looked elsewhere and found a local endodontist who did the root canal for under 1300 , then I found another local doctor to to my cleaning and replacement for about $1800. In short looking elsewhere I saved about $3000. When I went to Robert Matiasevichs office I got the impression the company culture was over friendly, very shallow and superficial. It really does feel like the place is all about money and kind of gross.

For an endodontist in Santa Cruz I would suggest Dr Patel at Micro Endodontics of Santa Cruz.<//Review><gmapID>0x808e3fe4d4d0fd5f:0x10abe9e14e868853< /gmapID><Rate>1< /Rate><user>106161731235188656823</user>< Date>

{'time': 1457369632266, 'text': 'William,  I wanted to apologize that I was out of the office for your new patient examination.  It appears you feel you were mistreated and mislead by our team.  In all sincerity our goal is to become lifelong partners with you for your oral health.  The tour is our way of letting you know who we are.  Specifically, we have been serving Santa Cruz County for over 40 years,  can take care  of all of your needs in one central location,  and eliminate your need to coordinate visits with different offices.  In addition, I know you came to see us on a new patient special that was for all X-rays, cleaning and examination.  This was a special promotion to advertise our extended hours and was not designed to give you the impression that we are a discount dental office.  In addition, after going through your chart I was confused as to the dollar amount you say you were quoted for your work.  The notes clearly state that you already had an appointment for your root canal with another provider and you only wanted to proceed with the quoted $1400 for periodontal care.  Not sure where the $6000 came from?  Although I could be wrong.  In any case,  I would love to make amends to you.  Please contact me directly.  Thank you, Dr. Robert Matiasevich Jr. DDS'}</Resp>

Last thursday I had the dreaded "deep pocket cleaning" gum therapy perfomed at this dentist office.  Anna is my technician and she did a fantastic job.  This took about 2 hours and the process was smooth, simple and not scarry one bit!  I really appreciate the great effort Anna took to make me feel comfortable during the procedure.  One week later and no problems.  This is a very professional, carring and efficient staff.
Thanks

Like this place for their imported beer. If you are into that stuff come down to this liquor store located in Palmdale for some good price imported beer.</review>

Too expensive for the refills!
They charge like its a new cup!
If you got yo own cup and straw  you should only be paying for the drink witch is about 50cents to refill!< /Review>

It's a joy to have a place where you can find everything from parts for small electronics projects to high-end cables as well as knowledgeable, pleasant staff.  I fear that the gentrification of Hollywood will destroy this treasure.</review>

The level of expertise, wealth of product and overall good service is unparelled. There are very few retail stores of any type that can match Ametron. It is a rare thing to walk into a store that is so well suited to it's purpose. The best electronics store in the world.< /text>

Ametron be like this. You got this oddball item? Why of course we do Sir. We have 500 of those reverse karblunkers. Highly suggest you go and see the Microphone Museum. Ask for Hector.</review>

I thought this was a gold mine until I realized it was fools gold. Have a great selection of many things but often on the cheap side. Unfortunately, they wouldn't refund me for the crappy adapters that wouldn't work, without packaging , so my business goes elsewhere.</text>

< Review>
With the demise of Radio Shack I found myself in need of a new electronics store. Not just any old electronics store though but rather one that carried a vast selection of parts and accessories that were not your mainstream electronics. An electronics store that carried just about every shape, size, and voltage of every battery that has ever found its way into electronics gear (much like the battery selection at Radio Shack...RIP). I found all of that and more at And from. It doesn't look like much from the outside. You might not even realize that there is an electronics store here. Wait until you get inside though. It is electronic geek heaven. They even have an equipment rental division where you can rent the high end HD camera or audio mixer etc... That you need to finish a project. My only complaint is that it is sometimes hard to find those small electronic parts you are looking for because there is just aisle after aisle of diodes, circuit boards, cables, connectors etc. That is a pretty trivial complaint though when you consider that this place really is a one stop electronics store store. Oh....and if all of that wasn't enough, the prices are great too.</Review>

The service guy there walked me through what was happening and narrowed it down to two things; both of which would be about as expensive to fix as getting a brand new replacement of similar quality.  They did all of this for free while I was there and saved me the hassle of trying to fix it when it wasn't worth it.  Very honest and I would use them for any other electronic repairs I would need in the future.  That rates five stars in my book!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Worst electronic store in SoCal. Once you start talking/asking about diodes, resistors, soldering and ohms measurement, you'll find yourself trying to teach someone who's working in an electronic store what it is they do have but have no clue where/what it is!?!?  At least Radioshack tries to help you. Rude customer service, uneducated in what's surrounds them, very unorganized inventory and then (if you're lucky finding what it is you're looking for) you'll get overcharged. Save time and money -BUY IT ONLINE!!!! <==Strike 3 Amertron</review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Parked here Sunday 7/9/17. Took the kids to Hollywood for the evening during our recent vacation. The attendant said they close at 10. We came back at 9:57 and the huge metal gate was closed and locked. There was no phone number to call. After freaking out for a bit, i finally think to google them and find a number but its the number for the store and they're closed. My phone shows i called at 9:59, so obviously I was there before 10...I ended up having to pay for an Uber back to my hotel with the kids which was a 50 min drive. We were planning to stop for some food on the way back to the hotel (we were so busy in Hollywood we didnt have a chance to stop and eat so we were starving) and some milk for the morning because we were out but that plan got changed. Also ruined our plans for the next day. My purse was in the trunk of the car also. Thank God i had taken my credit card with me and not just cash because i would have had to take a cab and that would have been super expensive. And I also had to pay for an lyft back to Hollywood the next day to retrieve my rental car. I had to wait and keep checking for a time when the lyft price was actually reasonable. DO NOT PARK HERE!!! I was in California for a limited time and they took my money and my day from me!<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bf382f40413d:0x1c175dea0dd82ae8</gmap_id></record>

Friendly storeman Mike walked me thru all I would need to make the finest film/tv audio kit.  I then researched all he spoke to me about and found that not only the prices are the best the info given me was solid and useful.  I spoke to a customer for a short moment about how he felt about this store and he told me that if you work in Hollywood in audio then get acquainted with Ametron as they will become my best knowledgable friends.  I trust this place and will get my kit and all other purchases from them unless i find a better and extremely lower price on incidental items.  They understand that too but it will be hard to beat their prices on anything.  Wonderful store, people and prices.</review>

<Text>This is now my favorite dental office in years. They took great care of me when I went in for emergency dental work on 3 teeth. Staff is super friendly and helpful! Dentists does extractions really fast with a great personality. They definitely follow covid 19 safety. Highly recommend! If I could give them 10 stars I would.</Text>< UserId.>

The best dentist ever and they work with you. Always have had a great experience at this dentist. I first went to this dentist in 1989. It might take time to see the dentist. But be patient they will do a good job.<//review>

They tell me to come in earlier than my scheduled time incase they need to do some work on my teeth and since they close at 6 they wanna make sure they have time to do it. I come in at 3 was originally scheduled at 4:30. Didn’t get seen till 5:30 now all I got was x-rays, when maybe I could have gotten atleast something done. Don’t make me accommodate my schedule if Imma be waiting 2+ hours for just x-rays, x-rays shouldn’t have to take for me to wait 2 hours.

<Review>I really like this place the Doctor Mallette did an amazing job I was super worried and nervous but he was really nice and professional that he resolved my problem with  no pain. Go to the dentist is something that always freaks me out but this is the first time I am back home with out pain and happy.

Thanks God
Thanks Dr. Mallette</Review>< pictures>

They don’t have proper lunch schedules & making appointments here is useless! I was here an hour early to fill out paper work and it’s been a total of 2 hours and 45 mins and STILL NOTHING!

Take your business to a different western dental!

Unprofessional. Should have reported blood pressure girl and did a grievance for her yelling out, "Its because your black!" Wow... And guess what. Took atb and tooth still having pain. But i was turned away and not given service because they are unethical. The 2 spanish individuals in the front desk were very nice and respectful. Such a shame how ppl do. But god takes care of everything. Bet ya like that last statement. Have a wonderful life.<//Text>

<Review>IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD!!! Worst place ever - do not come here!! Customer service is horrible and they make you wait hours - 2-3 hours even with an appointment. My mother just had a surgical procedure yesterday. We must say the specialist was very good, but she asked another doctor for help and was very rough.  So rough he even hit my mother, i'm sure it was an accident, but still! We asked to switched clinics and they said we couldn't!! LIES!!! I just called customer service and they told me she can definitely switch from this horrible clinic!! DO NOT COME HERE!!!</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This place does not know how to work with different ethnicities. Native Americans have different teeth genetics and a dentist mistook that for a deformity and ripped out 3 of my moms teeth. If they don’t know this they need to go back to school and training.<//text>

< Review>
I had to wait over an hour after my appointment time for them to even start working on my mouth. Was seen by many different people and was being told many different things. It was taking so long I had to run out of the procedure room because I could hear my 10 month old crying and screaming in the waiting room because he missed me. I was told that I needed to get a procedure done(that I don't even need) ASAP; so naturally I start asking a bunch of questions about everything I'm being told. Later I hear them talking right behind me- about me because I'm asking too many questions. I had someone talking to me about Jesus and I had three different people tell me that the work I was going to get done in a few minutes was going to last an hour, then thirty minutes, and in the end it only took like ten minutes. Arshia the dental hygienist was very kind but she made sure I wrote a good review and gave them 5 stars. She stood over me and watched me do it, she even told me what to write. And by the looks of the 5 star reviews, it's done to a lot of other people. Never going back, smh.</Review>

My wife says every time she brings my daughter to her APPOINTMENT she has to wait more than 1 hour to  get called in. I brought my daughter not to long ago and shared the same experience...while other people come after me and get called in.. Their response was " oh they need x rays thats why " then they realize my daughter needs x rays aswell, so why didn't she get called in before other people who came after... Office people more concerned about donuts then paying attention to their job.. Screw this telling wife to change to other dentists, rather travel a little farther and people who are competent.<//Text>

Dr. Arshia did a great job with my deep cleaning. She was very kind and gentle throughout the entire process. Also had great recommendations for my gums.

I came in today for my cleaning and Dr. Arshia did a great job with my teeth. She was very kind as always and I will be coming back in 3 months for another great cleaning.< /review>

<date>1515424246972< /date><text>My 12 year old daughter has had a very bad history with dentist. We have gone to several different establishments and she would always be very nervous and in some cases she has fainted from high levels of anxiety, as a result if being in the hands of dental staff who where unconcerned with her pain or comfort level or with making a connection with here before performing any work. Being at Western Dental (Compton) was literally a breath of fresh air for the both of us. The staff immediately  introduced themselves and welcomed her in with a smile. Dr. Steve has a very positive demeanor and engaged my daughter by asking her about herself before ever looking in her mouth. He also asked her what some of her concerns where and addressed each one. My daughter mentioned that she thought she might need braces and he later discovered that she did, and referred us to the Orthodontist. The Orthodontist name escapes me at the moment but when he did his exam she was treated with incredible service as well as made to feel apart of everything that  went on. We were able to schedule both a future appointment for cleaning, as well as an appointment to have her braces put on and I received financing, payment arrangements and selected her preference on the style of braces all in one appointment. I am very please with our experience and would recommend anyone to this establishment.</text>< Resp>

I was a bit hesitant of taking my wisdom teeth out, but Dr. Kermit Mallette explained everything very well, to the point, and assured me everything was going to be okay. The extractions were taken out in less than 15 minutes and it did not hurt one bit. I will definitely continue to get my dental work done with Dr. Mallette.
D.A. Elizabeth was also awesome! She booked my extraction appointment sooner than expected due to my tooth pain. She assured me everything was going to be okay and I felt happy that she cared so much. She even came back to check up on me and made sure I was okay. I love the service!
D.A. Lorena assist Dr. Mallette with the extraction and was guiding me every step of the day and kept telling me what was coming up next to assure I was okay. She gave me great tips and hints on how to recover after the extractions.
I wasn't sure if to go to this location due to previous things I've heard about it, but today it definitely change my thoughts for the good. The staff that worked with me were kind,caring,and knew how to do their job correctly. I am grateful for the help they gave me, and I will definitely return for future work.<//review><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

My 12 year old daughter has had a very bad history with dentist. We have gone to several different establishments and she would always be very nervous and in some cases she has fainted from high levels of anxiety, as a result if being in the hands of dental staff who where unconcerned with her pain or comfort level or with making a connection with here before performing any work. Being at Western Dental (Compton) was literally a breath of fresh air for the both of us. The staff immediately  introduced themselves and welcomed her in with a smile. Dr. Steve has a very positive demeanor and engaged my daughter by asking her about herself before ever looking in her mouth. He also asked her what some of her concerns where and addressed each one. My daughter mentioned that she thought she might need braces and he later discovered that she did, and referred us to the Orthodontist. The Orthodontist name escapes me at the moment but when he did his exam she was treated with incredible service as well as made to feel apart of everything that  went on. We were able to schedule both a future appointment for cleaning, as well as an appointment to have her braces put on and I received financing, payment arrangements and selected her preference on the style of braces all in one appointment. I am very please with our experience and would recommend anyone to this establishment.</text>

Arshia did really good cleaning and is very thorough around my gums. I loved it.

Also I would like to add that Dr. MALLETTE did a great job and pulled my teeth sooner than I thought it would take. He did great  working around my braces.

Dr. MALLETTE did a fantastic job today again.<//review>

This is my 3rd visit here to see the kids specialist who only comes some Saturdays and again I waited over 2 hours this time all that waiting for a 10 second procedure, staff would keep on telling us that in 5 minutes they will start and what not so I'm over here thinking like ok he's getting his cavity filled, teeth cleaned and the removal of a brace since that's what the paper said he was getting done for the day, for him to only get his brace removed which took her 10 seconds to do.  The kids specialist was so rude to my kid who is already frigthened of dentist and even more now because of the way she was talking to him. I was told to go to the front to make an appointment and there's 3 people in the front (plus a workers kid) they see me and none of them acknowledge me, two are giving me their back while one is in front of me talking on the phone (which she was off the clock) if I wouldn't of said anything no one would've helped me but the one who helped me said I'm off the clock but I'll help her out. I'm not the one who like to make complaints but here I am leaving my experience at this location.</review>

Dental Hygenist Arshia was very  polite and patient with me.  The dentist is not my favorite doctor she seemed to realize this and assured me everything would be okay. She explained everything as she worked.  Thank you very much Arshia. See you again soon.< /Review>

Now I haven't been back to a dentist since because the experience here was so bad. The front staff is rude. The dentist or whatever he was gave me a full mouth deep cleaning without numbing my mouth at all. Any other dentist I went to before said they would break up the 4 quadrants into 2 quadrants at a time, and anesthesia would need to be used. I cried the whole time while sinking in the chair. The dentist scolded me like a child and said "maybe now you will try and floss more". I am trying to find out who to complain to or a corporate office number. I have Western Dental Plus insurance.

<text>They removed my braces in the most brutal way.  It cracked some of my teeth.  I haven't lost any luckily but the Dr older man with glasses is a real @$$hole. I taped him on his had and signaled for him to stop and he told me not to touch him.  He's careless. They make you sign a waver.  Go somewhere else.<//text><user_id>102301843763153065174</user_id>< GmapID>

I'm one adult who have always been jittery when it came to going to the dentist and to be a little more specific I never liked extractions because they never really kept it completely honest about the feelings I was about to feel or the noises that would always scare most people well today at western dental all that and some was the exact opposite Dr. Mallette was Awesome He Talked Me Through The Procedure from Point A To B From the Shots Til It was Over With And No I Didnt Feel Anything That was The Best Dentist visit I've had thus far if yall dont like extractions because they painful or the oral surgeon be too rough go to Western Dental And Ask For Dr. MALLETTE !

"Very horrible and terrible customer service."  Had 3 appointments ALL THREE failed and the tooth is still in my head.  Dr. Steve let was adamant in putting metal in my mouth for the upper roof of my mouth WHEN!!!! it was the bottom tooth that was giving me problems.  I want to say that I have a really GREAT insurance!! and when they noticed it.  He wanted implants instead of giving me all of the options that are available.  He came in right away to let me know that I have 5 teeth he will need to pull and told me sorry he had to bring bad news.  My thing is this!!!! "You are too focused on reading X-Rays instead of fixing the problem of why my face is swollen in the first place"</review>

THE WESTERN DENTAL OWNER'S REPLY IS A AUTOMATED SYSTEM EVERYONE GETS THE SAME  REPLY  TO THE  REVIEWS BY GIVING ME A EMAIL ADDRESS AND A TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CALL SO THAT WE COULD FIX THIS PROBLEM YET NO ONE REPLIED TO ME EITHER ON THE PHONE OR VIA EMAIL This clinic is very bad no customer service the staff doesn't care they are more interested in talking about lunch and reading a magazine then to input pt information or checking on their insurance when i set the appointment i was told it would take about 1 hours well 1hour later i found out that my paperwork was not being processed yet i lost 1 hour for nothing at the end i told the unprofessional clerk that I was not staying and that i was not going back to the clinic
This dental clinic is very unprofessional they cant even get me a appointment on the right day i had a appointment on Tuesday qnd they changed my appointment without my permission plus the call center instead of fixing my appointment the guy send me to do a survey and then my calls were hung up on me<//Review>

I had a horrible experience at Western Dental in Compton. I waited for about 2 hours and 20 minutes and in that time all they did was take X-rays. The doctor said that he was going to extract my tooth but then the dental assistant notified me that he cannot do it until another 10 days later. Never going back.</Review>

"Very horrible and terrible customer service."  Had 3 appointments ALL THREE failed and the tooth is still in my head.  Dr. Steve let was adamant in putting metal in my mouth for the upper roof of my mouth WHEN!!!! it was the bottom tooth that was giving me problems.  I want to say that I have a really GREAT insurance!! and when they noticed it.  He wanted implants instead of giving me all of the options that are available.  He came in right away to let me know that I have 5 teeth he will need to pull and told me sorry he had to bring bad news.  My thing is this!!!! "You are too focused on reading X-Rays instead of fixing the problem of why my face is swollen in the first place"</text>

Before even going to the actual place, I called for my dad to see if it was open & no one answered. I was on the phone waiting for about 25 minutes. My dad had a big injury at work; so big he almost had amputation. He went walking and although we live about 10 minutes away, with my fathers condition it took him 30 minutes to get there in foot. To even get there and the doctor tell him the dental deep cleaning costs $1000 and not one nurse or doctor told him it costed that much. He just went to go waste his time! Once you get here you will see all the bad service I'm talking about.</review>

Still waiting for 3 hours for an appt for my little sis that was scheduled at noon. The front staff were rude even when I nicely asked how long it would take. The first time they said she was next, the second time they said there is one person ahead of her, and that they have been backed up since 10:30 am. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND this place.  As you can see this ismt the first time a patient hete has been waiting for more than 2 hours.It could be that their clock on the wall is stuck at 1145 when I checked it at 230.< /Text>

Customer service fine. Dentists awful. Told me I needed a root canal when she did not even have a current x-ray of the tooth. The tooth has never hurt. The dentist I saw prior said I needed to have a tooth pulled because the crown fell off and it was too short for porcelain. That's why I had an art glass crown on it which fractured. What an idiot! art glass crowns have been available for at least 25 years. Dumb girl- just wanted to pull teeth and give me implants.
The second dentist I saw prescribed Ibuprofen even though I told tech I could not take it because I already take Voltaren. Then dentist told me she prescribed Voltaren when she extracted teeth! Voltaren is not for acute pain. It helps my back just enough. If I have a headache, cramps, sprained ankle, it is useless.
Do your dentists come from the remedial school of dentistry? They have insufficient knowledge on available dental treatments and medication. It appears Western just trains them to sell, sell, sell. It is creepy and offensive. I will not be back.</Text>

Very bad experience been there 2 years and they cancel my appointments without letting me know, tell me a price and then they change it last minute ,they never give me my appointments when I need them for ortho is always 2 months after , the waiting time is ridiculous like 2 hrs I don't know why they do appointments if they are not going to stick with them, the girls in the front are very rude and always answering back in front of other patients that i think is unprofessional, I  can't wait for my braces treatment to be over after that I'm never going again for cleaning or nothing<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Recently had solar installed with better earth, Ethan and his team were excellent. Was very skeptical after some of the other places I've talked to about solar but Ethan gave me straight forward info and I never felt like he was trying to sell me and even after the install when I had questions he has been responsive and made sure I got the correct answers to my questions and the system has been great and even exceeded our expectations especially after getting my first bill and it being better than I expected. He didn't over promise but he definitely delivered on more than expected. Very happy with the entire experience. Thank you Ethan.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Great experience with Jake and Chance from Better Earth. When we first talked to them, I was very cautious. Not only they gave confidence in their service and product, with 25 years of warranty, but they provided me with prompt and accurate responses to every question that I had. They got me a great deal on a new roof, the best price for our solar system with Solaria 400 W panels, on time installation and clean workmanship. During this process, Jake was always available through the phone and text and email. And one thing that I cannot emphasize enough is that I always felt he is on my side.< /text>< Date>

Jake and his fellow worker Nate were very informative about their product and answered all of our concerns about changing over to Solar. Better Earth installed our complete system in one day and were very accommodating when it came to running the conduit and installing the converter so it wasn’t noticeable from the street view. Better Earth gave us a good bid out of the three companies we interviewed for the project. Can’t wait to see my savings on my electrical bill.< /Review>

I decided to go with Better Earth after an initial consultation with my sales advisor, Ethan Tryhubczak, who answered a few lists of follow-up questions I had with speed, patience, and thoroughness. I was encouraged by his passion, honesty, and attention to detail during my information-gathering phase, as there's a lot to grasp for first-timers. The entire process takes several months between survey, purchase, permit, installation, and connection, but I'm very happy with the end results, as I can already see the reduction in my utility bills and feel like I can make a small contribution to renewable energy vs. fossil fuels. It's a big shift, so to truly understand how it works and the various considerations, you need an executive broker like Ethan who can guide you over the course of those months, and who will always be available to answer questions that pop up.<//review>

He was not only nice, he was also very knowledgeable, patient, and thorough. He gave us the detailed explanations about solar panels that we needed to feel confident in our decision to go solar. The installation team was also great. Thank you so much!

<rate>5</rate><Text>Just finished with the installation of our 16 panel array on the roof. Rodney and his crew were great. They were on time, professional, friendly, and quick. The whole array was on within one day, and it looks slick; the panels look like they are just meant to be there.
I worked with Ryan Tessner to get the whole process started and he was great to work with as well. He made all of the numbers easy to understand, gave me realistic timelines, and kept me in the loop throughout the process. I'm looking forward to sustainably generating our own power.

Bryan has been in regular contact with us along every step of the journey, informing up about what would happen next, when, etc. Everything has happened on schedule and last Friday Nathan and his team came and installed the panels. They worked quickly and efficiently and the panels look great. It is so nice to have Bryan and Better Earth taking total control of everything, making the process totally painless for us.

Abby and John made the entire process easy. We have been looking into solar for a while and finally decided to jump on board. They took care of everything from the estimate to the actual installation. Josh and his team did a really good job on the install and answered all my questions. It's been about 6 weeks total so the entire process has been pretty fast. Great warranty program for my roof and my equipment, which was the main reason I chose to hire a professional. Highly recommend,  especially if you are already on the fence about it.</Review>

Staff refused to send a written quote with their pricing, warranty and details of the system. Poorly designed with panels proposed on our patio cover. Met with three companies and they were by far the least professional. Salesman was rude when we told him we were going elsewhere due to their lack of transparency (see screenshot). Recommend looking elsewhere, all of the other companies showed up with a detailed quote in writing.

Review Update- Was promptly contacted by Better Earth management as a follow up to my review to get more information. While it does not fix the comments and lack of professionalism from their local sales staff, they are reviewing the incident which is appreciated.<//text>

<text>Better Earth rescued me from a stalled and ultimately doomed Solar project I had in progress with another Bay Area company. I had gotten just short of the initial "site survey" when COVID hit. From that point on, that company said they couldn't proceed and then eventually filed for bankruptcy. Better Earth had pinged me a few times in a no-pressure way. I eventually decided to give them a shot. Within days I had a better deal in place, and a site survey scheduled. My only worry was cancelling the original project, which they helped me complete. Even despite the challenges of Covid, Better Earth delivered in rapid progress. Cameron, Devon, and the Installer Nathaniel were wonderful to work with. The installation was top quality workmanship. And the installation team were incredibly polite, and friendly. The system was live and online less than a week after installation and inspection. I would say the very best part has been the responsiveness. At any time, I could reach out via text to get an update, or answer a question. No other customer experience compares.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM03K_aB3uLDui4_wXsqX4RxnCaYjIqsr0ooFtN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrbybF6wuC_MR2N_ZqtSjbot6q7fVinL-bMNhx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2eLBNY3IXyzi4qVnOzbRtZVyFE1Kbt-68JirK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9dVnHFQpGwqTk85NXb7gU3bbJ2S71_2xqZ7Of=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm4TgeJaC-EoFCmkuAZK3R7ZoDqZoxbPQMeBgv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><user>100471632769333048366< /user>< rate>

I had Solar panels installed a month or so ago.  Over all I´m very happy with my decision and with the Better Earth company. The process is not instant. It started in December when I signed the contract. and only at the end of March I was congratulated on using solar (!)  It was explained very clearly to me from the beginning that it takes a little time (3 months on the average) to have the system installed and working because there several stages of getting the permits and each phase takes time.  Chance and Peyton were my original contacts and I found them friendly, knowledgeable and responsive to my calls and emails.  I was delighted to work with them. I also had to call customer service on a couple of occasions and had very good experience with Michael and Bianca.</text>

Chance and his team were awesome.  We could not have been happier!   From the very beginning, they walked us through the entire process and answered all of our questions with great detail.  The genuine and passionate part of the Better Earth experience was Chance actually listened to our concerns and made us knowledgeable and confident with the transferring to solar process.  Communication was incredibly clear and responsive and all deadlines were met (if not early)  Installation was efficient, professional and most important the Solara equipment is totally state of the art, looks great and works as promised.  I would highly recommend Chance and his team!</text>

I was then contacted by Nick Chavez from Better Earth Solar who was extremely patient and willing to assist in any way he could to make the process easier for me when submitting the proper documents.

Not only was he patient when I was losing my patience with the move and getting settled in to our new home but he was and still is willing to help with any questions I've had regarding the city permits and installation ect. Needless to say I'm very happy and impressed with Nick and his customer service skills as well as his knowledge on the business of solar panels.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Excellent Customer Service!! My husband and I had some serious doubts about Better Earth / Simple Solar after a not so pleasant experience with one of their inexperienced field sales reps. If it had not been for their customer success coordinator Bianca Mendoza, we would have walked away from this solar company. I contacted the company regarding my issues, extremely frustrated and upset. Bianca was very pleasant, understanding and truly listened to what I had to say. Despite my tone at times, she remained calm, soft spoken and professional. It was her personality, phone demeanor and professionalism that made the difference. She was honest, polite and was truly there to help to resolve my issues. Throughout the entire time of  resolving my issues, Bianca kept her word with staying in contact as well as assisting me with getting the issues resolved. Her work ethic and customer service skills are outstanding!!!  Bianca thank you again for your assistance and making this business transaction for me and my family a better one! I truly thank and appreciate the management staff for working with Bianca to resolve our issues.

I have had the best experience starting from day 1! Connor Green has provided exceptional service and provided us with so much information! He was patient as he answered the same questions multiple times. The company has kept in great touch via email and text so we were in the know as we progressed. Our panels were installed last week and Connor checked in throughout the install. The install crew were polite and cleaned up afterwards. Now to get the switch turned on!  Thank you Connor for knocking on my door!<//review>

Amazing work from better earth. I was not thinking about getting solar until Sean explained to my family how solar works so we could understand and listened to any questions or concerns we had and genuinely cared about helping us. We looked at two other companies to compare panels, price and service but no one compared to the quality and dedication of better earth. One month from signing up, we were installed. The install team took time to explain the process and their work was very clean and quick. I could not be happier, I now have confidence in solar and pay far less for more energy than before.< /text>

We have had a great experience so far with Better Earth through the install. All employees that I have met with are professional, courteous and thorough. Rodney Home and team made quick work of the installation of 14 panels on our roof last week. Looking forward to receiving our first tiny power bill before the summer! 😊 Thank you team!< /Text>

<review>Our Experience with Better Earth Solar has been great!  I have to say we were skeptical on Solar, and heard some horror stories about people working with Solar companies and having Solar installed on their homes.  After our first meeting with Emerson and Marshall, we felt like much better about the process.  Not only were we working with some great people, but felt like Better Earth Solar was a great company.   Our Solar Panel installers were great, very knowledgeable and did a great job.  Clean Install!

< Review>
Connor and Derek did an excellent job facilitating my installation for the solar system. I paid $0 out of pocket just like they said. I received a flyer on my doorstep detailing the program and they explained that I would have to pay $0 upfront to own my solar system, I get to use an extra 16% power throughout the year and I completely replaced my PG&E electric bill with a solar bill that is 50% cheaper and stays flat! It really is a no brainer. First time looking into solar and I'm glad I chose Better Earth because now I won't contribute to some of the horror stories I've heard about friends going solar with bad companies. Thank you Better Earth! Already referred some friends to them and now I'm getting referral bonuses!</Review>

Great company, great customer service.
Preston, our sales rep, did a great job explaining all the details of the actual costs, benefits, installation process, rebates, and financing.

They handle all the necessary permits and coordination with PG&E or whatever utility provides your electricity.

They use very high end panels and other equipment (with a 25 year guarantee!) and their installation crew (Oren & Halid) did an excellent job with great attention to detail.<//text>

<Text>Just had our adjunct solar panels installed today … and we are pleased with the result. We have still to undergo the requisite local inspection and PG&E’s visit, but the heavy lifting is behind us. From Noah Neill educating us on the solar energy gains that will be delivered by Better Earth … to the reliability and workmanship of Rodney, Orrin, et al. installing the panels on the roof, we are convinced Better Earth is “obsessed with creating the best customer experience.” Thank you to the entire team!< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< userid>

< Review>
Too many disconnects with Better Earth Solar - Very pleasant to work with Connor and Brenden- professional but a few things could have been done better. Also once the sale is done there is no contact provided to follow up. Here are a few things that need improvement:- contract - we brought to their attention some critical misses that resulted in Better Solar updating their standard contract; Sales tool to estimate the usage/ production vs. the detailed technical specs were off. Sales tool predicted we will produce enough, the technical specs showed after 2 years we have to start paying as we do not produce enough. It resulted in having to upgrade the panels that Better Earth Solar had to cover but still not a good experience; Panels were installed 12/8, inspection was not done until Jan. City permit approval was sent to PG&E on 1/13 however the documents sent to PG&E did not have the inspector signature. It was communicated to Better Solar on 1/19 and Better Solar did not reply to PG&E with the updated documentation until 2/2 (10 working days later) We finally received approval on 2/9. So more than 2 months to get things going, delays that could have been avoided. Meanwhile, we paid the deposit are starting to pay the monthly bills but no connection yet. We could have been approved on 1/14.So overall not impressed with the overall process to be able to provide a referral.

2/11/2020 UPDATE to  my original posting - I was pleasantly surprised to received a call from Dean to follow up on my review. He wanted to have a full understanding of what went wrong so he can provide feedback to the operation/support team. I really appreciated that he took ownership and that he acknowledged that they are growing too fast and they need to put more resources in the back end. To take ownership and acknowledge that there were misses it shows that the business cares about their customers and clients. Feedback is very important to ensure processes get better. Thank you Dean for following up with me directly, for listening to my situation and for making the commitment to make improvements.< /Review>

Buyer beware. This place is a bad deal for you, the consumer. Definitely recommend getting at least 3 quotes from others, don't let the sales pressure get to you. These people charge premium prices (comparable to sunpower) and they don't even tell you what model solar panel you'll get in advance, because they look for whatever is the cheapest at the time. No legitimate installer does this. They promise 315W+ for these premium prices, but the top of the line is 380W for LG or REC and you can find installers that charge, 10-20% less than these guys.  They also do shady things like door-to-door sales. My sales guy was super shady and asked to do a credit check asap, and before I had a second to think, my credit score was damaged. He also told this manipulative sob story about getting the sales commission to go travel to visit his son. They have these  loan options that look really attractive on the face,  but oddly, they charge 15% more for panels when you use these loan options as opposed to buying up front with cash. They of course, don't tell you this, and no one else does this.<//review>

Just had a great first intro presentation with Better Earth. Extremely responsive. Texts me back immediately. The presentation was extremely professional, informative, easy to understand. Can someone update me on their experience 3 years in with this young company? If you put a 5 star initially, are you still happy?<//Text>

One of the worst experiences I have ever had. They started my project in December of 2020, it is now going on July of 2021 and I still have no functioning solar panel system. There crews except for one person have been rude and left my property a mess. There rep stopped returning my calls after he sold me the product. Their customer service is a joke and they often fail to notify me when people are coming out. To make it all worse they have started tapping my bank account and when I call to complain they send me through a serious of hoops to get reimbursed and make it sound like its my fault. Disgusted and disappointed with a company I thought had a good reputation.</Review>

<Text>We were skeptical of solar for a number of reasons and were quite concerned that the panels would not detract from the street level view of our home. The reps spent plenty of time with us answering questions about the package. They also went over the financing of the project and what those obligations were very clearly. They were very accommodating to our request concerning the aesthetic concerns. The project was completed as promised and on time. The installers were efficient and ensured the hardware was well installed and that the conduit was painted to match house colors which was appreciated. Overall experience was professional and well done.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>It's been 7 months since I signed the contract with Better Earth and my solar is still not ready... It took about 5 months to update main electric panel and install solar panels. Final inspection failed more than 1 month ago and still not able to schedule for inspection fix and completion. No replies when I emailed or texted them to schedule the fix. They keep saying they are working on it when I called. But I have not heard a word from them . Communication is terrible. The company cannot do what they promise.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
We recently got solar with Better Earth. It was a pretty straightforward process. We looked at several options, including Tesla (less cost but many bad reviews), and Better Earth offered competitive prices and has excellent customer service.   Devin Rainbow, our sales rep.  explained everything in detail and answered all our questions. He made the process pain-free and kept us up informed during the process.   The company takes care of everything  (design, city permits, installation, etc.). They use high-quality, smaller, and nicer-looking panels.   There are serval payment options from zero down to pay in full.   The tax rebate is 26 % for 2021 (used to be 30), bringing the price down.  Electricity with PG&E keeps getting more and more expensive, so this was a no-brainer.   We should've done this sooner.  I highly recommend Better Earth.< /review>

Chance Pronschinske and the team at Better Earth Solar have done a terrific job with the installation of my system for my home.  The entire job was completed in 3 months with most of the time taken up in waiting for the permits to be issued from the city of Napa.  The research that went into the project was all inclusive.  By taking a yearly average of the amount of electricity that was utilized  the exact panels were installed barring the use of an electric vehicle.  I have seen a gradual increase on my PGE bill since October 2020.  Ranges from $500+ during Christmas to a monthly average of $400+  to 300+.  Just got my new bill for August 2021 of $36.00. Not going Solar is a no brainer if you want to save thousands of dollars in PGE costs.  One day installation was fantastic and Chance was always there to answrer my questions and to assure me everything was moving forward in a timely fashion.  Also knowing that someplace in the world that someone was recieving clean water from my purchase was an extra bonus for me!  I highly recommend Better Earth Solar for all of your Soar needs!

Good luck ever getting a hold of them once you sign.

They left for weeks at a time and did not come back to finish the job (Apparently they overbooked installs frequently). They damaged my property and did not fix it. They had to make repairs during inspection in order to pass because they didn't do the job correctly the first time. The final straw was they shorted out my panel when they left and i had to hire an electrician to fix it because they teenager they had doing the job was not skilled enough to fix their own mess-up. They never paid for the electrical bill i got to fix their shoddy work.<//Text>< Pics>

We had a great experience with Better Earth Solar.  The two sales people who introduced us to the company were thorough and were available to answer all our questions quickly.  They kept us up to date on the process and the installation date.  And the installation itself went very smoothly.  We highly recommend Better Earth, and our looking forward to doing our part for the environment with our new solar panels.</Text>

<text>When l decided to get my solar panels it was based on false information that was provided to me. I found out that my neighbor got a 1% interest rate to where as mine is 6% and my credit score is over 700. Further more I don’t see any difference on my PGE bill, l don’t see why I should of even gotten the solar panels. Very disappointed!!!!</text>< pics>

The Better Earth team led by Michael A. Mazza the Co. Energy consultant and the installation team were terrific in all respects. Michael provided a thorough review of our usage and led us through the process of sizing the system and coordinating approvals and schedules without a hitch.  Dan and his team of 3 were right on schedule and did an excellent installation paying attention to every detail all in one day. I was especially impressed by their organization, efficiency and quality of work.  I highly recommend this Co. They are truly committed to achieving a Better Earth.</text>

It was just my first month with my brand new solar system from Better Earth, producing the power needed for my home. The whole crew was super helpful and did a fantastic job during the installation and permit process. Very clean and professional.
I was a bit hesitant at the beginning since so many well-known companies were giving me similar quotes. Still, after investigation, I found they were using lower-quality panels/inverters, or their customer support/user experience was terrible.
I would highly recommend Better Earth and specially Devyn, who was super helpful and kept us up-to-date and well informed during the whole process - so gratifying to get free, clean, and efficient energy for my home (#earthday).<//Text>

<Review>My wife and I were looking at solar for our new house. We've looked into another solar company, but never heard anything from them. When approached by Mike the solar guy about solar we were all ready interested, but even more so after talking to him. He didn't sell us on solar, he sold us on an opportunity. His enthusiasm and knowledge of solar sold it for us. His genuine personality made it easy to do business with.  From the jump you can tell how passionate he is about solar and how knowledgeable he is. He makes you feel at ease with every step. Any questions we had, he knew the answer right away. He is available anytime you need to talk with him. He's made this process so easy.

We just finished our scope of work and waiting for installation. I'm glad that Mike the solar guy is working with us and made us feel at ease. If you are looking for solar Mike the solar and better earth are your best bet. They have a great rate and will be able to save you money. Make sure you ask for Mike the solar guy. When you got Mike you got the best in the biz.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>We, too did NOT have a positive experience with Better Solar.  The solar consultant from Better Earth (who signed us up) was not truthful with the timeline, did very little to keep us informed about our project (nor moving it along) after we signed the contract, gave excuses throughout the process and towards the end just stop communicating with us.  He originally quoted us 4 to 6 weeks to get the unit up and running, including the roofing after we signed up.  We signed up on January 9th.  He also assured us that, "I am here to help you every step of the way and keep you updated."   In our last communication on May 10, we asked the consultant why this project is taking so long and to let him know that we cannot understand why we have heard nothing(once again) for 10 days after he promised an inspection and the system should be up and running within 10 days after our last communication with him.  Once again, there were several excuses.  Then he tried to deflect it to the company saying, "Let me find out what is taking so long."  That is when we found out, he never formally put in our request for the final inspection and to have our system turned on.  We stayed on the line while he communicated with his company and he did give us a confirmation that Better Earth will start the final process to turn on the solar.   Again, that should have happened in 10 days.  Then another 2 weeks went by and we heard nothing from the consultant OR the company.  During that last communication, we let our consultant know that this has definitely not been an experience where we can refer others to.  After that comment, he would not respond to us and that was the last day(May 10) we heard from him.

When another 10 days went by, we had to take matters into our own hands, but was not sure who we should communicate with.  We were never given any other number, other than his, and we had no names of his managers.    We found one general e-mail address on the Better Earth website so we e-mailed the complaint(because we wanted it in writing), asked for a manager's contact and that is when we got a response the next business day from a representative of the Better Earth company.  She did apologize for the "consultant's lack of communication."  She assured us she will now handle the project.  We questioned her why the company had not gone through with pushing our project through when the consultant gave us a copy of the confirmation.  She would not answer or address the question we asked and simply kept repeating that she would take care of it from this day forward.   Better Earth was then able to get the city inspectors to come out the very next day, send in the application to Edison's approval a few days after that, and turn on the system after approval, which takes 1 to 2 days.  The solar was up and running in 6 business days after we spoke to that representative. So why nothing happening before we communicated with her, which is the question.  Never-the-less on June 16th, we finally had our solar hooked up.  That means, it  took a little over 5 months since we signed up to get the solar system.  That is a huge difference from the 4 to 6 weeks that were initially quoted to us.  This means that we lost out several months of payments that could have gone towards our new system.  Instead we continued to pay Edison for our electricity for those few months.  The representative would do nothing about that and would not even address it when we brought it up. This whole process was frustrating(excepts for  the workers that put on the solar panels were hard working, quick and polite) but never-the-less most of the handlings by the "consultant" and "company" were unsatisfactory, so we will not be recommending any friends or family to get solar though Better Earth.</review><userid>111003239633217192706< /userid><date>1624937832411< /date>< Pictures>

< Review>
Even with Edison's voluntary electricity saving measures done during the summer months, (usually on the hottest days of the year as it would turn out), our electrical bill was still around $366/mo. Then we met Marshall from Better Earth Solar. He made attaining solar EASY and a smooth transition. We now pay $116/mo. Thank you Better Earth Solar team!

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Over all I'm happy with my solar install, we will see how the next 25 years go.  I went with Simple Solar, they are the sales team and they are part of or in contract with Better Earth. From the Start the dealing with any one in Middle management was a epic fail. After the 1st issue I actually ended up talkin to the CEO, Moe, and we got everything back on track. The actual install went as scheduled the 2 men that showed up were great, the were professional, and worked hard, they did a great job. After the install was complete I was waiting for the city inspection, in the next  2 weeks I got calls and emails from the finance dept. wanting there payment, but I heard nothing about the Inspection. Week 3, I was told  we were waiting on the city and it was out of there hands (middle management Fail). 2 more weeks I got nothing, so I made a trip to Town Hall to learn that the city does its Inspection the next day of a request, and there is no back log, also confirmed there was no request in for a inspection at my address. So I was back to making more phone calls, I called there customer service and talked to Mrs. Bianca, I told her its been 5 weeks since the install and filled her in on how I felt about this situation.
Mrs. Bianca was very professional and promised to look into it. I received 2 phone calls back in the next 24 hrs,  She had the Inspection date set up for 5 days out and every thing was back on track. The 2 young ladies for the inspection team showed up the morning of the inspection. They were very professional, new exactly what they needed to get done and did it. Most impressive was the inspector threw some curve ball questions about the fuses that were used, and the girls had the correct paper work sent over to him with in minuets, made the inspection go very smooth and passed no issues. Mrs Bianca was in touch with me 3-4 more times keeping me up to date with the process to get the hole system turned on over the next 2 weeks.
In conclusion, the hole project took a little longer then expected, but I have a quality solar system installed. I would like to thank Dom my sales rep, Moe From Simple Solar, the 2 young man that did the Install, and the 2 ladies that did the Inspection, you all were great. Bianca from Customer service went above and beyond to make things right and restored my opinion of the company. I would recommend Simple Solar and Better Earth to my friends.< /Text>< user>

<Text>Best customer experience for sure-- our whole solar conversion was concierged so smoothly and easily!

I knew I wanted to get solar-- we had been buying Marin Clean Energy from PG&E but I wanted to get batteries and be more self-sufficient when there were shutoffs. (In recent years I've been relying on a diesel generator to pump our wastewater out during power shutoffs-- literally to flush the toilet.) But in the past I had been turned off (uninterested/intimidated) by the complexity of all the solar players and complications for homeowners.
The landscape seems to have changed now-- there is now great financing,  clear rules for transferring ownership of panels, and a really streamlined system.

Better Earth Solar in the form of Leila Seppa (our personal Solar Concierge/Queen) was exceptional. They did the research, figured out which (high quality) panels & battery that would be best for us, found the financing, organized permits and inspections, provided an amazing installation crew, helped me make the exchange with PG&E, all while being perfectly lovely.

It was SO EASY. And I didn't lay down any cash. And my monthly bill will be less than my regular power bill. I'm powering our family with solar energy, and we have battery power to sustain us through power outages. SCORE! I'm feeling triumphant. Thanks, Leila!< /Text><name>Jeannie Koops-Elson</name>< time>

I worked with Logan and Better Earth to set up the right solar option for my home. He was very friendly, knowledgeable, and followed up with me through the whole process. He took care of everything. The installers were also amazing and worked very quick... they even went the extra step to paint electrical piping the same color as my house. Highly recommend Better Earth, great service!<//text>

< review>
Overall, I am very satisfied with the solar panel package that Better Earth/Simple Solar installed for me.  The end package was installed as should be, and the the quality of workmanship and the handling of the business were well done.  The entire project from start to finish took approximately 12 weeks - the process involved contract signing, site survey, engineering plans, building dept. application, installation, signing off project by the building dept., application of Permit To Operate to San Diego Gas & Electric, approval  of PTO, turning on solar panel system to send electricity to the power grid (this also included navigating through the Thanksgiving/Christmas/New Year Holidays and dealing with the slowdowns from the Covid Virus).  Comparing this time frame to that of my next door neighbor who signed a contract with  a local electrical contractor for installation of a solar panel system - he is 9 weeks into his solar panel project and the installation itself has not even started yet.  A big thank you to Better Earth!< /review>

Sean Burgin of Better Earth solar was very helpful and instrumental in our Better Earth experience. Sean explained the process and kept me informed throughout the entire application, setup and initialization. Sean Burgin provides excellent customer service, and we are very pleased with Better Earth Solar. I recommend.

<text>Had a great experience with this company. Jace was always available to answer any questions I had and if he didn't know he was not afraid to say so and find out. That impresses me. The install team was fantastic. My home is an older St Pete, Florida home and so the electric bill can get rather high. Making this move will save me an average of 50-150 a month depending on the season. I am so glad I made this step.< /text>< pictures>

The sales guy (Nick) was great, not pushy, very patient and always looking for my best interest (I researched 4 solar panel companies).

<Text>Mike and his team were phenomenal. From our first meeting, he accommodated my schedule and needs.  He was upfront and clear on all options and pricing.  His approach was very upfront and easy to to understand, which made it very easy to make a decision.  After our first meeting, I knew Mike and Better Earth were the company for me.  The survey and design process was flawless and the installation impeccable.  Being an Electrical Engineer myself, I was interested in how they would install the system. I was blown away by the professionalism and quality of Wes, Sam and their team of installers. The team installed the system exactly as I wanted and the system is barely visible.

If you are in the market for Solar, go to Mike and Better Earth.  There is no other company that can offer what they do; exceptional service.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1618347103123, 'text': "Kunal, it was a pleasure helping you go solar!

<review>I have been a resident of San Carlos, CA for 25 years and when Keagan and Dylan showed up on my driveway one Saturday afternoon, I was completely resistant to their sales pitch, but before I knew what hit me, I had done a complete 180. I was more than impressed with the level of knowledge these young men both demonstrated about their Company, Better Earth, their mission and the solar panels themselves. I would highly recommend them to anyone who is considering going Solar. Better Earth is your answer. Keagan and Dylan were amazing and still are to this day, as they stay in touch to ensure I am pleased with their company, their work and their product.<//review>< Resp>

Marshall and his team were awesome. We could not have been happier! From the very beginning, they walked us through the entire process and answered all of our questions with great detail. The genuine and passionate part of the Better Earth experience was Marshall actually listened to our concerns and made us knowledgeable and confident with the transferring to solar process. Communication was incredibly clear and responsive and all deadlines were met installation was efficient, professional and most important the equipment is totally state of the art, looks great and works as promised. I would highly recommend Marshall and his team!</text>

Better Earth was super transparent about the whole Solar installation process, how the billing would work out, clearly explained the system benefits, set & met expectations, and answered all of my questions promptly throughout the entire process. Shout out to Andrew: you were great! We had a minor issue where the switch panel needed to be moved due to an inspection issue (it happens), but Andrew quickly addressed the issue, and set up the correction appointments and follow-ups. Now I'm watching the green graph on our monitoring system, and feeling great about helping the environment (and getting away from PG&E as much as possible). :)<//text>< Response>

This is our first time getting solar and you definitely need to talk to Michael Cavaleri. I can't say enough good thing about this guy. I promise you, he will make you feel like you are his only customer. He gave as a wonderful deal, he was attentive, always available to answer questions, and just a really pleasant guy to work with. Our solar was just installed a few days ago and it looks great! We can't wait when it finally gets activated. Thanks Mike for all your help!< /text>

<review>We want to do our part moving toward cleaner energy, and Cayden helped us start that process with solar. He was there to update us and answer any questions every step of the way, and it’s only been about two months from start to finish. They handled all of the scheduling and permitting, and we really like the energy generation guarantee that they provide. Can’t wait to see how much we generate each month!<//review>< Date>

We established a great connection and was an absolute pleasure to work with. We had a great rapport and he thoroughly explained every single benefit of having solar.

Better Earth Solar has been great! I could not believe how hard the technicians worked to install my solar system. They installed 33 panels and a battery backup system in one (long) day, they were not going to leave until the system installation was completed. The Better Earth team members are extremely responsive, responding to any of my questions within hours. The system design is amazing. The system has been operating for a little more than one month now. In the first month of operation, the system produced more energy than I actually used, even with operating my air conditioning for a week. My first PG&E electric bill was $11, which is the State mandated minimum. The system has a 20-year performance guarantee and I anticipate many more months/years of minimal utility bills!<//Review>

Justin Girard was by far the most professional representative of a solar company that I have ever been in contact with. I've been pitched solar countless times by countless companies and the reason I decided to go with Better Earth is because of Mr. Girard. Not once did he make it feel like a sales process, it felt more like a consultation of my wants and needs in regards to the efficiency of my home, which is exactly how going solar should feel. Justin answered all of my questions and if I ever had a question that he did not know the answer to, instead of lying like most salesmen would, he let me know that he would reach out to someone on his team for the right information, which he did. Better Earth is out here doing a fantastic job and I will be telling all of my neighbors about Mr. Girard's professionalism.< /Text>

Best ever decision we made, sign up for Solar system.  Long overdue to be exact.  but, the best part is having a Nicholas Chavez as our Salesperson, he's on point, focused, and customer care is top notch.  Nicholas has a good  follow through skills and his persistence is up there, in a good way.  Nicholas, thank you for your non-stop follow up, if it was not for your persistence, we're still dreaming for that solar sytem.  You're a gem to Better Earth, they are lucky to have you as part of their team.<//text>

Better Earth Solar had a team of knowledgeable guys in our neighborhood going door to door. The day they came, my husband was at work, so I asked if they could arrange a time to come by when he would be there, to hear all the information as well. They were so accommodating with scheduling a time, and even brought donuts and coffee. They were able to answer all our questions and get us set up so quickly. Our team has been there every step of the way, and often checks in on us. We are really happy to be taking a step towards green energy in our household, and also reaping the financial benefits it provides. They have been a wonderful team to work with and we highly recommend Better Earth Solar.< /Text>

We were helped by Connor and Branden from Better Earth. And the whole process was smooth and hassle free. The company took care of permit application with the city. We were cc'ed and kept updated about the progress, but didn't have to do anything. The installation work was done in just a few hours. The workers are nice and they cleaned the floor after the work. The work passed the inspection in the 1st round, with a minor issue. But they fixed it very quickly.
Connor is knowledgeable about the whole process and we got all our questions answered before we started. And he responded my messages in a prompt way. Overall, it's a very pleasant experience working with them.< /Review>

<review>Door to door sales of solar. The Better Earth rep started by talking as if they were with SoCal Edison, but refused to show ID. When I started to record her, it suddenly changed to “In partnership with Edison... and the Federal Government.” Only when confronted with her evolving story did it come out as a solar roof company trying to lock people into leased equipment on my roof. 1 star for the dishonesty: just wear ID, say who you are and what you are selling from the get go instead of trying to trick the elderly.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

My experience with Better Earth has been phenomenal! When Justin and Levi came to us about solar, we were very uninterested because we already had 8 solar panels on our roof that were originally built into the house. Justin and Levi explained that they were simply there to make sure we still didn't have to pay the LADWP since we had solar, which we were. In fact, we were still paying about $400/month in electricity to the city of LA. After seeing this, Justin and Levi quickly made us a design showing us how they will remove the old panels and replace our system with a brand new set of 33 panels for the same price we paid for 8 panels through SunPower 8 years ago!!! There is no question that these gentlemen and this company is of the highest quality, Better Earth has been nothing but amazing to us and our family and I am so glad these boys knocked on our door.< /Text>

< Review>
I see all five star rating for this company. I am not sure if these people were given any incentives to write these reviews. I did not have the same positive experience with Better Earth. They aggressively worked on trying to sell me the solar panels back in September. I signed up with Better Earth and crickets after that. I had to text my rep with status on multiple occasions. First they tell me we are waiting on a permit, or a part, and I am having a meeting with Execs to talk about your install, I will update you in two hours.  That was a couple days ago.  Poor customer service follow through with the customer.

6/9 Update- Installation did not past inspection. Andrew the representative asked me to take down this review since it has been installed. I refused and he started insulting me. It has been almost a year and I still don't have working solar panels.

6/11 Update- Vendor for Better Earth came the other day to fix the breaker. Inspection was done today with PG&E and we asked the Better Earth vendor about exposed wires and why did they dig up the concrete expansion joint.  The guy said " I don't know, I am here for the inspection, call the hotline".  Then he walks over to truck, starts cussing up a storm and throwing things around.<//Review>

Marshall, Our project coordinator, did an awesome job with SolarEdge to make our issue process seamless and promptly solved the issues. We have some issues recently and Better Earth Solar Team able to promptly resolved the solar production problem. We’re able to monitor our solar system again after solving the issues in timely matters. Because of their customer service action we will recommend Better Earth Solar to our family and friends.

When I first met Jay Toulouse my sales rep. I Had not made yet made up my mind about putting solar on my home. I still had lots of questions.
I was impressed with the information she had about the company she represented Better Earth Solar.
furthermore she was able to answer the question i had for her about solar. if there was a Question that she did not have an answer for she was usually able to get back to me with an answer that day via text. This impressed me. I decided that I would like to hear more about Better Earth and what they had to offer. Long story short I decided that I would invest in Better Earth Solar for my home thanks to Jay Toulouse and her professionalism and knowledge the Company and what it had to offer. I have to say minus the delay because of the pandemic temporary shut down, the schedule for installation of my solar panel system from start to finish was right on schedule as promised.
Thanks again Jay and the team at Better Earth for all the great work.</text>

It was such a pleasure to work with Kyle at Better Earth; he walked me through the entire process, and I'm very happy with my solar transition so far.  I am so glad I made this change, and thank you Kyle and the rest of the Better Earth crew.  I will definitely recommend this company to my local homeowner friends.< /Review>

I have 4 customers that have been waiting for 2 months and havent even recieved permits. I was told today it will be another 30 to 45 days before they install. The sales manager promised 30 day installations before we brought our clients to Better Earth, paperwork has wrong pricing and weeks of back and forth still no resolution. Stay away from this company until they figure their operations department out</text>

I have been very pleased with process from beginning to end. The initial conversation with Chance which began my process in deciding whether or not to go with solar , he was readily available  to answer my multitude of questions via text, email, phone and video. Once I decided  to get solar the process was pretty seamless and BetterEarth took care of all the paperwork including permits and appointments with the city. Any members of the BetterEarth team that needed to be present at the house including the installers were respectful and mindful of Covid guidelines and were masked.

Every time I have called the office for any questions for customer support , they have been very prompt in getting back to me and helping address my questions. I think I may have spoken with Bianca at the office when I have called and just like everyone else I have interacted with via phone or video, she was professional and able to address my questions.

The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that there was breakdown in submitting the final paperwork for approval to PGE. I signed the initial documents for PGE at the end of December . Something happened and it was not finalized and I had to resign the documents again at the end of January.

That said the general manager Dean was quick to respond to my questions and concerns when this arose which I appreciate and he stayed in constant communication until the paperwork was resolved. When I submitted the paperwork to PGE the second time, everything was in place and approved in less than ten days .

We are very excited to now have Solar and stop paying those excessive fees to PGE< /Text>

Jay Toulouse walked us through the entire process (virtually of course) with grace, patience and skill.  Through all the challenges created by COVID,  Jay and the rest of Better Earth Solar have been a joy to work with. After decades of wanting to go solar, it is finally a reality.  Thank you!< /review>

Ethan and his team came on time and it was a one day operation. Good communication. On top of that we had over 90 mph winds a couple of days after the installation and they all stayed up on roof. The solar isn’t running yet until the city inspector comes to inspect it.<//review>

<text>I have been considering solar for a few years but I never got enough input, only sign on the line blah blah blah. Kyle Lowy has helped me from the start and I couldn't be happier. I was given a proposal showing the exact cost, payments, energy savings and we were offered a system that would exceed our demand so the chances of having a year end slap in the face bill we're greatly reduced. I opted for a battery backup which will allow us to have power even when SCE decides to cut off the hood because of wind and fire threats. I will refer their company over and over. The design, savings and warranty have satisfied us and we haven't even had the system installed yet!<//text>< Rate>

<name>Edward Medeiros<//name><date>1582128029325</date><rating>5< /rating><Review>I had an amazing experience with Better Earth right from the beginning. Andrew was a pleasure to deal with and everything he promised was followed through with great detail. I had to pay no money down, and there is a short delay in paying your first bill which is great. Andrew had my system designed and ready at our meeting. When we spoke I was able to add more panels to increase my system for future household renovations. The program was showing me my monthly bill(since I financed) if I added or removed panels, which is a great bonus. My monthly solar bill is roughly $100.00 LESS per month than our electric bill, and I added more panels!! The installation crew were the most professional and courteous people I have dealt with when it comes to contractors. The crew lead, Jacob, was the best. His crew: Jonathan, Vincent, Ruben, David and Dillon were amazing. They were professional, neat, detailed and took every safety precaution. If you have Better Earth install your system just ask for Jacobs crew, maybe you'll be lucky to get them.< /Review>< pics>

Marshall T introduced me to solar one day him and his associate were in neighborhood. I was at first skeptical but after getting some honest answers I decided to proceed with consultation. By then I had even more questions which were also answered. After I agreed to go for it,whole system was installed within a month. Started producing just a week ago and everything is great. Being able to see how much system is producing via App is great too! I’m paying less a month owning solar than I was paying electric Co. Marshall has answered all my questions and still keeps in touch. He’s one of the reasons why I decided to go with Better Earth and it’s warranty. I would recommend.< /Review>

We have been wanting to go solar for a while. A lot of other companies couldn’t get us set up with out the removal of our redwoods and existing pool solar, but Better Earth could. They got us approved within a day, then had the inspector come a few days after to check everything out and then the install was done quickly in one day, all within a 3 week time frame which is awesome! I know other companies might take up to a year! I’m looking forward to ditching pg&e for electric and having a positive impact on our planet with solar panels!! Nick walked us through the whole process and explained everything very well. There presentation is great, customer service excellent and they have great referral incentives too!!</text>

Please folks, if you’re interested in solar give Ethan a call. Very professional, strong follow-up, excellent installation. I’ve been professionally selling for many years so I know the difference between (amateurs/hustlers) salespeople and professionals. These guys are the real deal... you can trust them! My system looks great.

I love the mission of Better Earth in their work to create a more sustainable world.  I've also hoped that I could own an electric car that I could plug into my roof.  Almost there!

<review>We went with Better Earth solar because both of our neighbors recently had solar panels installed. Their experiences were so positive that they convinced me to give it a try even though we already had a small system with another company.

I am the type of person who watches every penny and I was a tough sell at first as I was unsure if an additional system would really be worth it. Michael Mazza & Nick Cavaleri answered all my (excessive and numerous!) questions and worked with me to get the power I needed for a low monthly cost.

After getting my system going, I recently had questions regarding the first bill. I was confused because the monthly energy bill was exactly $0, which was surprising since the panels had only been operational for 10 days. Again, Mike and Nick were there for me, going above and beyond to help me understand the details of the bill.

I was so impressed with their price point, service, and product guarantees that I even recommended them to my parents. After speaking with Mike and Nick, my parents were sold and are in the process of getting their panels installed, earning me a $500 referral!

I never thought I would be looking forward to my next electric bill. I absolutely recommend Better Earth solar!< /review>< name>

Overall, I’m very happy with the results and process that Jake at Better Earth led for my 16 panel installation completed in Oct ‘19. Jake was super responsive and proactive, and did a good job answering my many, many questions and requests! The install is performing as expected and looks great. My only reason for knocking off 1 star is due to a few missteps during the initial design and costing - which Jake quickly corrected - and a little sloppiness by Freedom Forever in the install where I had to redirect placement of the inverter, and they left debris in my yard and garage. I did appreciate Freedom’s flexibility in the design at time of install though to minimize visible conduit.< /text>

Better Earth was the first solar company that made sense when they did their sales pitch. They are very knowledgeable about the whole process from the materials used to the technology behind solar energy. Any questions or concerns are promptly addressed. Perhaps best of all is the stellar service. Michael A. affirmed for us that we chose the right company to go solar. He always made time to answer our questions and concerns from the planning to post-installation stages. This is why we have highly recommended them to family and friends and will continue to do so for anyone wanting to go solar.</review>

My wife and I had 'solar' on our list of upgrades for our home and when we sat down with Chris Berlin we couldn't wait to get it online. Chris was very thorough in walking us through the technical details and designing a system that made the most sense for us. The rest of the Better Earth team was very professional and prompt...thanks B.E. team!< /Review>

< Review>
Man, where do I begin... I would recommend that you get Better Earth as your next Solar company. I really believe that this company is genuine due to my own personal Interaction  with their employees: Kane and MiketheSolarGuy. I was tired of paying a hefty bill each month. When Kane and Mike theSolarGuy said that they might be able to save me money on my Gas and Electric bill, my husband and I decided to jump on it right away. We were skeptical at first so we asked lots of questions about payment, and how panels gets install. MiketheSolarGuy told us that if the numbers did not add up, meaning we will spend more or break even switching to their company, then he doesn’t  recommend us going with their company. Well after crunching the numbers, he saw that we stand to save $200 each month, so we went with them. I felt like I have known these individuals for years  but I only met 3 weeks ago. Thank you Kane and MiketheSolarGuy for taking the time to explain the process and procedures
To update you guys, I had my solar panels put on last week, Wednesday. The team was awesome! You guys rock for putting on my panels when it was super cold outside and no one complained.  Not only did you put up the panels, you came back to ensure that it was installed properly. Thank you so much. We are now waiting for the final phase which is the inspection. I can’t wait to finally enjoy the fruits of your labor and save me some money. You guys Rock!! The Team was consist of Crew lead: Jerod, Electrical: Terrance;
Lead Supervisor: Terrance; panels: Nathan and Thomas. God bless you all!!</Review>

I would like to tell you about my experience with Better Earth. I have reached out to a few solar companies and had a few meetings with them. At first I was going with the big name brand solar company, but in the end they were going to screw me over. Somehow my wife found this company and we had a meeting. Matt Kelly came to my door, not knowing that I had already had meetings with several solar companies before talking to him. So I had an idea of how this already worked. I come from an extensive customer service & sales background. So my goal was to see if he was going to be honest with me from the get go and not just try to sell me some BS. Matt was very professional and truthful with what he had to say. Keep in mind he had no idea I had already spoken to several companies. I was very impressed with his professionalism, and willingness to help me get the best system for my home. We have agreed on a system, but after him taking it back for review they discovered that the one system I had chosen to go with was not going to be enough for my home. So he gave me a call trying to explain the changes over the phone, but I'm one of those people that needs to see it in writing. Needless to say Matt set up another meeting with me and my wife to review the new changes and to see if I agree with them. Matt was so kind to bring dinner that night for my family and go over the new plan. Granted I paid a little bit more, not much, but I got a better system out of it. Once all was set and done the system went up quick, Matt was also able to get me a permit to cut a large pine tree in front of my house that would cover some of the solar panels. That saved me a ton of time trying to contact the city myself. The only bad thing out of this was waiting for the city to come do the final inspection and give the permission to operate. Which is out of their control. I finally got my first DWP bill after running my solar panels and it came out to $22. During this time last year I was paying over $600 for electricity only. Solar was so worth it. Out of all my years in customer service & sales Matt Kelly is a true definition of a professional. I definitely recommend this company for your solar needs. Ask for Matt Kelly you won't be disappointed with his professionalism.</review>

I was that prospective solar customer that had all of these bad preconceived ideas going in and Steve Ducey quickly broke all those barriers down by supplying great detailed information, coupled with fantastic customer service.  Three of us neighbors formed a committee to vet solar companies and after meeting with six different companies, there was no comparison to Better Earth, their staff, and what they offered.  I even called Steve a few times at 9 o'clock at night.  If he wants my business he will answer, was my thought process.  Sure enough, he did every time and never made me feel like I was a bother.  It's sometime hard to compete on price when your competition will drop their short just to get the business.  But if you take the time and do the research, there is no solar company out there that will compare to Better Earth.  Sometimes it's not all about price,  sure you need to be competitive but wants more important is the quality of the product, quality of service, and the buying experience.  You will not get a better buying experience and service, in the solar space , then you would get with Steve and Better Earth Team.< /Text>

Customer since summer 2017. Andrew did an excellent job sizing and designing our solar installation. The installation was done with quality components and workmanship and on time. Andrew was responsive and pleasant to work with. The team took care of all the permitting. They provided the latest generation panels and I have been very impressed by the amount of electricity generated all year long. Since then Andrew and the team continue to be responsive when I have questions about our installation.< /text>

<GmapID>0x80c2c71e2aef39d5:0xdd4bbf7dba504d41<//GmapID><Review>I couldn’t be happier with Better Earth’s rep Ethan Tryhubczak who patiently answered my millions of questions, worked with me and helped when I researched the best options and was a royal pain 😀, and was and is there every step of the way before during and now when my system’s been up and running. And I’m persistent and relentless so he lived to tell it all! 😀 Despite being a young company these folks are reliable, very professional, passionate about what they do and progressive. I’ve checked them out. David and Warren who installed the system so efficiently and fast already got flying colors comments not only from the City inspector but also from Sunnova’s independent inspector who came today to do a random inspection and said the same thing - they have a great system. And yes, the German Q cell panels produce even when it’s overcast or when they’re shaded. They’re German, after all. 😜  I’ve interviewed a few companies in the past and this one was by far the best. According to my research and also according to my people feel I can highly reccommend them as well as Ethan specifically. He’s a good guy to start the process with. Plus he has a sense of humor besides being professional and took a lot of abuse from me without even flinching 🤣. Intelligent people are a good find.
In any case, it’s awesome to run your own power plant and drive your electric car on your own sun rays produced electricity. Not only do I love avoiding the LADWP electric bill but also and mainly contributing to helping this planet and making it better - Better Earth!!! 🌎 🌍 🌏< /Review></record></dataset><record>

He has kept me informed and has done an excellent job of informing me of all the processes it takes for Solar.  I am looking forward to having a low electrical bill for the first time in decades!!!

This process was amazingly easy! We had met with 2 other solar companies and was not comfortable moving forward. I clicked on a link and Stevie B called. Man has endurance because I didn’t answer for weeks, but when I did, I loved what he was saying and it came with ease talking to him. Set up a video conference with my husband who is a hard sell and he was sold immediately. Quick, easy and painless! By the weekend, our solar panels were installed in one day and we are on the road to helping our environment and saving money!</text>

They  promised a lot and delivered on all of those promises.  We are now saving real $$$ each month and wish we had done this sooner.

Excellent customer service!  Never to busy to answer or research any and all questions we had about solar.  We are extremely happy!!!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

We increased our existing solar panel footprint and are now generating more than we use for the entire year. It is great to finally be net generation positive! Better Earth, and specifically Nick and Mike, were fantastic partners in the process. I loved how they moved quickly--even during the Great Covid Lockdown of 2020. Even while practicing safe social distancing, they still were able to get the panels installed and help push through the necessary permit and reviews. I was really impressed with how responsive they were and took care of all the details. I strongly recommend using Better Earth.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Jay and Rob from Better Earth Solar were amazing. Highly recommend them to help you through your solar process like they’ve helped us through ours. They seem to over promise but I can say with all honesty that they over deliver. We signed our contract and got installed within two weeks. If you are thinking about going solar you def want to give these guys a chance to earn your business because it will be the best decision you make.< /review>< Pics>

<text>Where to begin - wanting solar BUT who can you trust?!?! Well, then came Andrew Zambetti - his incredible knowledge, experience and genuine care helped us in every possible way!! Throughout the entire process, Andrew was there to help - if not in person then by phone or email. We have had our solar for over 3 years now and so glad we made the right choice. Even now, when I have a question or concern and send Andrew an email or leave him a message, he responds very quickly. Continued TLC should be Andrew’s middle name - he is the ultimate CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE!!!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1583789588554, 'text': 'Thank you so much Wayne.

I shopped around for a good Solar provider and finally settled on Better Earth after weighing all my options. I believe they offer the best bang-for-the-buck in terms of service and production guarantee. Josh walked me through the entire process and was always available to answer questions. My system was recently turned on and I couldn't be happier! Better Earth will be getting all my referrals moving forward.< /text>

My experience with this Solar program has been great thus far. My sales person was Andrew Zambetti. Andrew was very easy to work with and explained the details clearly. He was very responsive when I had questions as well. I was very impressed that setting our home up with solar came at no cost to me. The installers were awesome too, very professional and courteous.
So far, we have continued to save $$ each month since we converted to solar with Better Earth Solar.

Ain't no one gonna read the 58- 5 star reviews, but they will read the 'least stars' post, so here ya go. Dealing with this company has been absolutely fantastic. I was hesitant about solar at first but when Andrew Z. explained it all and had it all in writing, my nerves were settled. The panels on my roof were great and complemented my house perfectly. My panels drastically cut my PG&E bills and the best part of all, there were no upfront costs just had to get approved to make sure I pay my electric on time, and another great thing is that it's completely transferable with no hidden fees, super great. So the reason for the 4 star is solely to get you to read my post or else it would have been a 5 star and that Jesus is the only perfect One. So simply put, I highly recommend this company, a great bunch of professionals that're trying to better the planet. Thanks again for the awesome panels!< /Text>

They handled everything from getting permits from our HOA to switching over from our power company. Once we signed, we really didn't have to do a thing and the system works great! We have one consistent bill every month and it's less than our Edison was the past two years, particularly in summer. I highly recommend Moe, Better Earth, and switching to solar!< /Text>

Today our solar panels were installed! A completely painless process thanks to Moe Falah and the authorized dealer who stood by us and walked us through every step of the process and keeping us informed. We were excited to take advantage of the tax credit and be able to own our panels. Even more excited to eliminate our electric bill and be able to run our air conditioning without a worry about cost. Thank you so much! Nita & Walter!</Review>

We had been approached about solar on our house a few times in the past and it never made economic sense.   When Marshall Tuten  from Better Earth came by our house a few months ago, I could sense his integrity and he wasn't trying to "sell me something."   Marshall persisted -- politely --- like any good salesperson would, and we continued the dialogue.  I did my homework and had several questions -- all of which Marshall answered with honesty and integrity.  At the end of the day, "it just made sense" to install solar from Better Earth as they not only promise energy savings, but also a 25-year performance guarantee .  We are looking forward to cost savings on our electricity bill and "future proofing" against increasing rates from PG&E.</text>

<text>Stellar company with a great offer! We chose the company for the following reasons; length of warranty which was longer than the life of the loan, ability to
monitor not just the install process but output of panels, and the guarantee that we’d receive a check for the difference if we ever used more electricity than the solar panels produced.
I was initially unsure since I had not heard of the company before but I double checked everything Matt Kelly shared with us and found it all in writing. He was quite knowledgeable. I then compared the offers from Better Earth to several other solar companies including SunRun through Costco and SunPower through our local co-op.
Matt Kelly was a great help. He was always accessible and stayed in touch with us through the entire process. I highly recommend Better Earth Solar.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
I have people knocking at my door about solar panels for a few years now. Rob’s timing was impeccable when he rang the doorbell.
(because I was home, and I answered the door!!).He had a big smile on his face, and a lot to say about his company, the Better Earth. He came back with Ethan who is equally nice and knowledgeable. And the rest is history!!! I was locked at a price I couldn’t say no to. I was so happy with my savings, I started talking about it to my family and friends. Because honestly, it’s a no brainer. What I love about the entire process is, I didn’t do anything!! Rob and Ethan did all the work for me. They even got my neighbors sign my HOA permit forms for me!! And I promise you, ( this is probably what people are scared of), there’s no upfront fee or any down payment to get this thing going!! I got an appointment to install the panels within 2 weeks, and the panels were installed yesterday, Valentine’s Day!! I hope that anyone reading this review will get inspired to get their solar panel with Better Earth because they were there for the entire process, and they are ready to answer any question you may have, and most of all, they will save you money. Happy saving!!!<//Review>

working with Nick Cavaleri - Nick has been diligent in not only getting us a great deal, but the service BEFORE and AFTER has been second to none. Response time to our needs has been terrific and the turnkey approach of taking care of the A-Z of installation and permits is seamless _ I would highly recommend Nick and his team to anyone even remotely thinking of installing Solar.< /Review>

<Date>1596247664971<//Date><text>***UPDATED REVIEW***

Revised July 31st

I posted a very negative review last night due to a variety of issues we experienced. First thing this morning, my husband received a call from Michael Cavaleri, apologizing for things that should not have happened and offering to make things right. I have to admit that I was not expecting to get this issue resolved. I thought we were just stuck with a bad solar company and all the 5 star reviews baffled me. I’m impressed with just how much Michael and his team care about their customers. He’s not the one we made the deal with, not even the manager that was in charge of our account, but he went out of his way to renew our trust in Better Earth Solar. Now I know this is not the way this company typically does business and that we just happened to fall within the cracks for whatever reason. A lot of companies will react to one star reviews by responding under the review with a bunch of excuses. Not Micheal. He took the time to find out who we were and got our contact information, so he could reach out and help us find a solution. This proved to me that this company does in fact care about its customers and that our reviews actually matter to them. I feel confident we made the right choice when we chose Better Earth. Thanks Micheal! I will be passing along your contact information to other family members who have expressed an interest in installing solar panels too.

Posted July 30th
If I could put zero stars, I would. This company is just out to make a deal. Once your loan is approved and they have your money, they don’t care about you AT ALL. We signed the contract April 28th. Installation didn’t happen until JUNE 10th. They blamed it on the virus, which was easy to do. Isn’t that so convenient?Our city’s inspector didn’t come until JULY 9th. They blamed it on the inspector, but given our experience with this solar company and the experience we’ve had with our city’s employees, we know this was all Better Earth Solar’a doing, or rather lack of doing. Every time we contacted our sales person, all we got was excuses. Two weeks after the inspection was done, we were sent the documents to sign to send to PG&E. Yea. That took another 2 weeks. They didn’t submit the form we signed until the following day. This doesn’t sound that bad, until you realize that the form only takes five minutes to complete and could have been submitted the same day, since our process was already taking an inexcusably long time. We emailed the manager, Danny Roundy, on July 23rd, and have yet to hear from him. He completely ignored our email. We told him that we were set to go with Sun Run, but were promised a better deal by this company and that we had trusted they would follow through. Well, we’ve already paid huge PG&E bills for May, June and July. It’s August, and we’ve yet to have our panels working or to hear from Danny Roundy. STAY AWAY from this company and go with Sun Run!!! I wish we would have done the same. Now we’re stuck with nonexistent costumer service and with the PG&E bills we were trying to avoid.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Didn't actually know how good my experience with Better Earth Solar was until I had a bad one with other company. Just bought a second home in Arizona that already had solar on it and it has been a nightmare to deal with. Terrible customer service. Andrew with better Earth Solar has been wonderful to work with even two years after the installation he still stays in touch regularly. Too bad all solar companies aren't like Better Earth.< /review>< pics>

Buying solar from Better Earth was a GREAT experience from start to finish. Cameron and Devyn were professional and kept me updated throughout the process. From the time I met with them and signed the contract, to installation day, it was only one month!! And the installation team was awesome. So friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. I would highly recommend Better Earth and working with Cameron and Devyn on your contract.<//text>

Working with Andrew Zambetti was one of those retail experiences one dreams of having and which is so rare these days. Andrew listened to us and our concerns, responded honestly, and offered us a PPA (with free installation) that has met and exceeded our solar expectations. We save money every month, and some months we pay $100 less than we were paying the electric company at the same time of year. The installation was done beautifully in one day, and we didn’t have to deal with the permitting or utility hookup. There were no surprises. On top of all that, Andrew is the most personable, friendly, and straightforward representative of ANY business that we have ever dealt with. And since he checks in with us periodically to make sure everything is going well, he continues to be very impressive.</text>

The panels are up now and we're waiting for the system to get turned on.

I’m forever grateful that Devyn courageously engaged me outside a restaurant in a conversation about solar amidst my complaints to colleagues about PG&E. The professionalism, expertise and deep attention and care that ensued by both Devyn and Marshall blew me away and I knew I wasn’t dealing with an ordinary solar company. The process of getting the information to help me make my decision, to signing the contract, to having the panels installed almost immediately and in a day during the holidays was remarkable. If only more companies and their reps (not just solar) operated this way!!<//Review>

Im grateful for this company. I wanted to get a system put in but 3 different solar companies said I couldn't get solar because of my roof. Better Earth went the extra mile to find a way to do it. I was still skeptical to let them do it but i trusted them and their roof warranty, and in the last 2 years of rain we have had no roof leaks or issues. They did the install in 1 day. My neighbor told me how much they're paying for Edison now and its gone up so much since I got my solar. Im so glad I did this and couldn't imagine if I had been paying them this whole time.

Andrew Zambetti was delightful to work with as he thoroughly explained the product, benefits and installation procedure. The crew was very professional, courteous and finished the project in a timely efficient manner. The system did not cost us anything out of pocket and the crew even replaced a faulty electrical box with a new one (free of charge) in order for us to meet the code. Andrew kept in contact during the installation to make sure that all went well. He also help us with the billing arrangement with SDG&E, We have seen a reduction in the monthly bill and are anticipating even more reduction as spring approaches with more intense sunlight. Thank you Andrew for all your help. Eric & Debbie Miyamoto</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

From the beginning to active the solar system was taking about 2 months and I am very happy now can use it means starts saving money due I am living in Tri Valley area, my PG&E bill was $400+ in summer time, I can’t wait to see my new bill. The first person I was spoke to is Dean Sharabi, he is super good; he follows up all the different stage, and the company is so reliable even while waiting for different stage processing they were called and let me know the updated status, I am highly recommend Better Earth Solar.< /text>

At first I could not believe that I could get a solar system without paying money out of pocket, but after meeting Andrew, he showed me all of the details and fine print and IT IS REAL. My panels are installed, my bill was cut in half, and I didn't have to pay anything. I also own the system, which is big because I didn't want a lease. The installation was done so professionally that I did not even see where they installed the panels at first and called andrew because I thought they didnt install them when i got back home! Great company, Honest, and a no brainer!< /Review>

<Text>I had been “thinking” about getting solar for years and had talked to several people. For some reason timing was not right, I didn’t connect well enough with the people that I was speaking to, or didn’t get good enough reasons as to why I should go solar. I met with Mike Abbruzzese while he was out knocking doors. He was nice to talk with and in detailed explained and laid out as to why I should get solar and what Better Earth could provide. Mike was patient with me and waited for a while and when I finally pulled the trigger he made sure that every thing went as quickly and smoothly as possible. Freedoms Forever were my installers and they were great too. I’m in the Plan To Operate stage now and should be turned on officially in a week or so. I feel like I got better equipment for a lower interest rate, a good over production estimates percentage, at the monthly amount that I wanted to pay, and an overall smooth process from beginning to end. #BetterEarthSolar #FreedomForever<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1581978020950, 'text': 'Thanks Chuck!

<Text>Just wanted to take a moment to share my experience with Better Earth for those doing research like I was before deciding to go solar.  I have nothing but praise for this company and their staff. I was fortunate to have Jack Mallis as my advocate throughout the entire process. Even though Jack works for Better Earth, I always felt like he was representing my best interests, was a wealth of knowledge and delivered on every promise he made. Jack was always available whenever I had questions and made what can be a complicated process easy for me the customer. Better Earth took all the guess work out of the equation by partnering with Freedom Forever and Divided Finance.  Both of these companies delivered on their promises in the timeframe agreed on. If you’re considering going solar, I’d highly recommend making Better Earth the first company you talk to. If you’re considering going solar in California, I would ask to work with Jack Mallis.< /Text>< Pics>

Josh Abbruzzese could not have made the transition over to solar any easier, broke down the process and steps easily for me to understand. If you haven't looked into adding solar to your home please contact josh or anyone at Better Earth and there is no way you will regret it. Thanks Josh and the team!<//review>

My first system was installed over 2 years ago and I moved a year later and had solar installed in my new place. The installation process is smooth and the panels look great on my roof. Love saving money and going green!

<Text>My husband and I sat down with Better Earth, Petersen dean, solar city and sun run. We even called pge and talked to the solar dpt. BE gave us by far the best package. I wanted the best rate and the best panels.  My husband is a mechanic and he looked over every spec sheet and installation plan. During the install he watched them and saw how they did the electrical wiring and racking device. He was very impressed with their work and he has near impossible standards to meet. The whole process took less than a month and install was done by 2oclock. The other companies were pushy and took too long. I'm referring Andrew zambetti and better earth to my mother and all my neighbors, everyone needs to get free solar and save money!<//Text>< date>

<review>I rarely write reviews but this company deserves it. Solar can be confusing and after months of shopping different solar companies, my husband and I finally decided to go solar with Better Earth. We are so glad we did! This has been the best experience with a contractor I've ever had. Here is our story along with our decision making factors:

1) Better Earth offered every top product in the industry. This made choosing which system to go with easy since we had been researching different panels and inverters online and they had them all. Our consultant could answer every question we had and knew the ins-and-outs of the system/solar industry which was refreshing after meeting with some of the other companies who seemed to be good at selling, but weren't actually knowledgeable on how the system, industry, or installation works... Most importantly, Better Earth warranties the entire system for 25 years and was the only company who truly monitors the solar system and doesn't rely on the customer to do it. They back this up with a money back production guarantee. I've heard horror stories from friends who were stuck with a large utility bill at the of year due to companies not monitoring like they said they would so this was important to us. Sure enough, about 2 months into having the system our inverter had a malfunction and the service team replaced it the very next day. Although we had no idea that the malfunction happened, if they wouldn't have fixed it in time they would have paid us back for the power savings lost and this stands true for 25 years! Even when we read this part in the contract we were unsure of how reliable it was but Better Earth has gone above and beyond everything they promised. Score 1 for BE.
2) We wanted to make sure we were getting the best deal. Although some of the companies had a lower price, none of them had the service and warranty package or professionalism that Better Earth had. Plus, some of my friends took the cheap route with their solar and all of them had issues whether it was roof leaks, the company going out of business, or just overall lack of communication or unfulfilled promises which led to them paying more in the end plus headache. It seems like in solar, you get what you pay for stands especially true. We got a great deal on the German Hanwah panels we wanted for no money down and are saving money on our electric bill while we own the system and Better Earth maintains it! Everything carries over and there are no prepayment penalties if we every choose to prepay the system and/or sell the house. Score 2 for BE.
3) Our system came with a 10 year roof warranty which was on par or better than the other companies. But the main thing is we wanted was a professional job done from the start because we have a tile roof and were weary of anyone walking on it or causing damage. Better Earth partners with an installer that doesn't do anything but install solar systems (no sales team or finance team) so we felt comfortable letting them do the job. After only 3 weeks of Better Earth handling all of the paperwork and permitting with the HOA and city, the crew arrived at the time they said they would and were done in 1 day. They didn't leave any trash behind, were extremely respectful, and even painted the conduit to match my roof! The few tiles that they broke they replaced (free of charge). The system was turned on in less than a week. I didn't have to do anything or badger anyone to do anything, they handled it all.

Fast forward and my husband and I couldn't be more pleased with how our solar project turned out. Sometimes we check our monitoring app just to see what our system produced that day and it's fun to know we're saving money and helping the environment without any effort or investment! I hope this helps anyone struggling to make a decision on if they should go solar and who with.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMftmz7Kn3K4lgOKx3wTorkgyGq1aHKePVlCME=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

The process was very easy and simple and I received a follow up emails and calls before and after each step. Collin is a very nice and helpful guy. He explained everything before signing the contract.
I wished I could give this company and Collin more than five stars review.
Very highly recommended...</Text>< Pics>

The interior, with it's chairs stacked and tables lining the walls as if barricading an imminent attack, shows artifacts of authentic japanese ambiance that deserves to be enjoyed.

Unfortunate that we are still confronted with our collective challenge, 'Kushu Ramen' embodies that quiet strength needed to survive. Like an old western, a shootout in the saloon, I hope to see this movie end with our heroes having the last laugh.

I'll look forward for what the future brings to this charming area. As a community, we need to help each other to get us better than where we were. I say thank you, for all you do and will do.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c29746bae330d3:0x8191e11ecfc0a503< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Love this place!! There is always a huge wait, maybe an hour - on the weekends. But it's so worth it - the food is amazing, and the price is...uh prefect for happy hour! And happy hour is at the exact popular time, not some obscure weekday thing to attract more customers during a slow time to fill up their cash registers. They really do care, and give you great deals. That's why there's always a line. I'll give it 4 stars only because the raw fish isn't always fresh. But all the cooked stuff id 100% all of the time. I go here almost every month. I MISS THE HOUSE SALAD!! BRING IT BACK!!!< /text></record>

Very cheap and good portions so don’t go expecting a gourmet dish, however it’s still really good. I come here at least once a week to eat and get tipsy off the sake.

Mediocre at best.

Tried the ramen, sushi and Gyoza.
The ramen noodles felt the same if not worse than microwaveable ramen.
Sushi was prepared with overrippened avocado.
Gyoza was cold and soggy even though we asked for it fried.

I recommend only going here if you literally have no other option.< /Text>

Amazing (and very delicious) food for such a great price! I ordered their Takoyaki (squid balls with batter, topped with thin bonito flakes), a plate of sashimi (good for 2-3 people, with salmon and tuna), okonomiyaki (cabbage with batter), and their kimchi! I was so surprised at the quality of the food, especially at their sashimi plate. It was such a great experience. Definitely my go-to place now for Japanese food.< /text>

I've been here quite a few times but have only gotten the chicken karaage. Love this dish and it's worth coming back to this restaurant just for it. During the dinner rush hour this place can get packed so be prepared to wait. During off hours though there is plenty of seating. A big plus is this restaurant stays open late. The service itself is hit or miss. I've gone when they are on top of everything and other times I've gone I had to wait 20mins after I had already finished my meal to get a server to notice me just so I can pay my bill.<//review>

Poor quality of costumer service.
I waited 10 mins just to be told to hold on.

Excellent generous ramen.  The good ocha.  Chan Pon made mom nostalgic for Nagasaki.
Patio dining is scenic of the parking lot, but staying strong in Times of COVID :)</Text>

<text>The first time I came to this place was during my college days a few years ago. The place hasn't changed much, the menu hasn't changed much either, just the food flavor has changed. Perhaps it's a different chef or different way of making ramen. I usually order the Ramen and fried Calamari along with either Sapporo or Asahi depending on where it was brew. The food presentation looks fantastic, the taste has definitely changed. Even the calamari has a rough rubberized texture and makes it unappetizing. Their draft beer is flat and doesn't help when trying to overcome the rubber texture calamari and taste.

Still a good place if you oversee the food taste and drinks.</text>< username>

I was also surprised to find a traditional Japanese dish that I loved when I was living in Japan. Most Japanese restaurants don't have this traditional plate so it was nice eat it...brought back some good memories. Enjoy this place and their food<//text>< Pictures>

The first time I came to this place was during my college days a few years ago. The place hasn't changed much, the menu hasn't changed much either, just the food flavor has changed. Perhaps it's a different chef or different way of making ramen. I usually order the Ramen and fried Calamari along with either Sapporo or Asahi depending on where it was brew. The food presentation looks fantastic, the taste has definitely changed. Even the calamari has a rough rubberized texture and makes it unappetizing. Their draft beer is flat and doesn't help when trying to overcome the rubber texture calamari and taste.

Still a good place if you oversee the food taste and drinks.< /text>

Local hole in the wall family owned Japanese restaurant.  If you are looking for affordable ramen,  this is your spot.  Their happy hour run till 9pm. Big bowl of ramen 🍜 + rice bowl = $9. Can't beat that!!</text>

Kyushu Ramen in Van Nuys was the first restaurant we went to after a 2 week trip in Japan…we were in the mood to extend our trip locally and this place is right around the corner from where we live.

We’re all vegetarians and were happy that they had options for us, though in practice it’s fairly limited what is available. We ordered 3 vegan ramens, one with spinach noodles (for my gluten free wife) and 2 with regular noodles. The menu didn’t quite match what was actually brought to us (it was missing the yam cake displayed on the menu. They told us after they brought it that they were out of that item. Lesson 1 or 2 for restaurant people: Let people know about changes before you put them down in front of your diners…we like to be served what we actually order.

Besides that, the ramen had lots of flavor. It was a creamy style miso broth, though it had limited extra ingredients.

We were happy generally with the flavor but would have liked more of the additional ingredients in the bowl.

We might try it again but there are plenty of ramen places in L.A. so it probably won’t be our first choice after this experience.<//review>

The service here is great! They seat you as soon as they can, even during the dinner rush. The food is amazing and they have so many choices so you never get bored with the variety. And they have this plum wine that is SO GOOD! Everytime I go I forget to ask what brand it is because I haven't been able to find anything like it nearby! Overall, great restaurant!< /Review>

<review>The place is relatively full at all times and kinda understaffed. There were only two servers and they truly were giving it their all. They both had a very nice and kind attitude despite of the fact that the overwhelming amount of work might have been too much for just two of them.

The place itself is clean and tidy. It has that typical japanese vibe and the decor and ambiance are reminiscing of any mom and pop japanese restaurant/shop.

The food is delicious and highly recommended. I had the Pork Cutlet bowl and so did my friend and we finished it in record time.

Highly recommended place to come if you don't mind the wait time (no chairs, host/hostess or lounge area, you just have to stand at the entrance and wait till one of the servers notices you, which might take several minutes) and you like excellent japanese food.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>This is not the first time I've had a negative experience with this restaurant, there have been several in fact.

30 minutes trying to get through on the phone to place an order, the line was just constantly busy.  Finally I get through, and I'm not even able to say a word when they tell me they're putting me on hold.  Not asking me if it's alright, just telling me.  So I go on hold....and I wait......and I wait....and I wait....and I KEEP WAITING.  Finally 45 minutes have gone by, still on hold, I said forget it their ramen is not worth waiting over an hour just to place an order.

I've eaten here before, it's alright, but the level of service has always been questionable at best, ludicrous or non-existent at worst .  There are other ramen place I would recommend trying for those of you like me who are tired of this nonsense of little to no customer service.  Like I said in the beginning, this is not an isolated incident, this is pretty common place.  I've been tempted to write reviews in the past about this place, but tonight just finally pushed my button for the last time.  I will not be coming back, I'll find another place.

Wait time: 1/10
Food quality:  5/10
Service: 1/10

<review>AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Read this post.

I've been coming here for 6 or 7 years now but after this Valentine's day I'll never be coming here again. My wife and I ordered our own ramen, hers arrived and mine never did. They never bothered to bring it by the time my wife waited and finished her meal. Tables usually feel dirty or sticky. If you're lucky you get a seat at the front  or a booth, if your unlucky you get seated on the left side where tables are so close together you can feel the people next to you cough and breathe on you. Better hope they aren't sick as well because the server will touch their dishes and then come right after with your food. The spoons used for ramen used to be nice but now always come smelling like dish soap or wet.

After paying for my wife's meal they just removed my ramen from the bill and acted like nothing happened. Went to ask for the manager and was asked by the staff if I wanted to order mine to go. No attempt to accommodate us after their mistake.

Manager never came. This place is horrible now. Enjoy the wait of 30+ minutes outside in the cold if you go during a busy time.< /review>< Pics>

I've been coming to this spot for the past 8 years. It's kind of a tradition to go here on Fridays. I have never been disappointed with the flavor or the service. There is a long wait every so often, but it's always worth the wait. The food is super delicious and the sushi is always fresh. They have a wide selection of foods. And they are always changing it up and bringing out new receipts. Some of the staff even know our orders. If I could request anything, it would be to bring back the green tea latte. My wife absolutely loved to go here for that warm drink.<//Text>

Change of management, waiting staff & chef. I hope to taste newer menu items next time. There are more in Japanese cuisine than meets the eye.</Review>

<Review>Found this place by accident, it has amazing food and great service. Pricing is not bad plus it’s open late. Great for those who work the swing shift like me.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I've been coming to this spot for the past 8 years. It's kind of a tradition to go here on Fridays. I have never been disappointed with the flavor or the service. There is a long wait every so often, but it's always worth the wait. The food is super delicious and the sushi is always fresh. They have a wide selection of foods. And they are always changing it up and bringing out new receipts. Some of the staff even know our orders. If I could request anything, it would be to bring back the green tea latte. My wife absolutely loved to go here for that warm drink.</review>< Pics>

Change of management, waiting staff & chef. I hope to taste newer menu items next time. There are more in Japanese cuisine than meets the eye.< /Text>

This is not the first time I've had a negative experience with this restaurant, there have been several in fact.

30 minutes trying to get through on the phone to place an order, the line was just constantly busy.  Finally I get through, and I'm not even able to say a word when they tell me they're putting me on hold.  Not asking me if it's alright, just telling me.  So I go on hold....and I wait......and I wait....and I wait....and I KEEP WAITING.  Finally 45 minutes have gone by, still on hold, I said forget it their ramen is not worth waiting over an hour just to place an order.

I've eaten here before, it's alright, but the level of service has always been questionable at best, ludicrous or non-existent at worst .  There are other ramen place I would recommend trying for those of you like me who are tired of this nonsense of little to no customer service.  Like I said in the beginning, this is not an isolated incident, this is pretty common place.  I've been tempted to write reviews in the past about this place, but tonight just finally pushed my button for the last time.  I will not be coming back, I'll find another place.

Wait time: 1/10

<text>The service here is great! They seat you as soon as they can, even during the dinner rush. The food is amazing and they have so many choices so you never get bored with the variety. And they have this plum wine that is SO GOOD! Everytime I go I forget to ask what brand it is because I haven't been able to find anything like it nearby! Overall, great restaurant!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Husband and I came here for Valentine's day. Terrible experience.

They never brought my husband's food for the whole time we were there 30+ minutes. Gave us a bill for my meal and a "sorry bout that." Left us alone after, took the money and expected us to just leave. Asked for the manager but they only offered to have us pay for a to go meal.

Manager never came. Family next to us was coughing everywhere and the waiters handled our food with their dishes after they cough all over. Dirty spoons.< /Text>

<review>This is a favorite place for many.  Reviews are great and people especially love their ramen! I’d have to honestly say that I don’t enjoy it.  I’ve tried the Miso and won ton ramen and although the broth is flavorful... I don’t particularly like the noodles or the Chashu.  I’m very picky!  I like the variety they offer.  I have had the donburi which is great! Next on my list to try are the rolls.  Their prices are affordable which is a plus.  It’s one of the better options in the area.  It can get crowded, and it’s a small restaurant.  Also, not all menu items are available for lunch.  Better if you come during dinner time!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmlvr7AUXUrSgPnN1qpjxS7WNqqitKBovwAXJ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

You want almost perfect shio ramen try this place , alot of ramen place offer creamy ramen but sometimes get tired of the creamy feeling , so i go here to get more of a broafy shio ramen it great when your sick and you wont get stomach problems later like other ramens. Make sure to asked for chicken fried rice is good sometimes they forget to add salt . Shio ramen with pork and chicken friend rice good combo.</Text>

Was a regular for years. Moved away for a couple of years and recently returned. Service has deteriorated dramatically. Bad attitude across the board from staff, poor service, poor attention to cleanliness of the restaurant, a total lack of respect for paying customers, and you will sit and wait largely ignored. Love this place for years. but it seems the ownership has changed, so unfortunately, I will not be coming back.< /Review>

This place offers real Japanese food. They imported lots of wild fish from Japan and cook it in Japanese way. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients it self. The price is reasonable as well. I love this place. I will come back soon and recommend it to all of my friends.< /Review>

Great food, great service, if i could give this place a 10 star rating i would! Our waitress was really nice and the ramen i got was perfect, not a lot of oil floating in it like some ramen places and good portions. My boyfriend got the beef teriyaki and he said it was awesome too! Definetly going back!</Review>

I like this place food is great... I just find that Tomkasu ramen soup is bad ! If you a fanatic of the ramen soup is ok but not really  good. Other plates are great. I feel disappointed about  tomkasu ramen soup... maybe other ramen soups can be better...
Looks like sushi are good. Lunch specials looks wonderful.
I will be back at this place, but not for find a good tomkasu ramen soup.<//Text>

Hmm where do I start.. well nice Japanese restraunt with alot to choose from but really came for the ramen soups. The spicy ramen soup wasn't spicy at all but it was ok. The traditional miso ramen soup was good but just didn't like the overall flavor bit eatable. I also ordered the jalapeño bombs and Harumaki and they were deilious. Fyi there actually 2 restraunts in 1. Overall not bad.< /text>

Tried it because it's right up the street. There are some low rated reviews on yelp which I don't agree with. Maybe they had a tough day or just to finicky. Anyways, I thought it was very good. Very generous portions and the squid legs were downtown.< /Text>

Not too many places stay open late. This one here is the perfect spot ..with Ramen and Sushi on the menu hmmm. When you are looking for quality food and not your run of the mill type of place. Come here to explore your taste buds. Be prepared for a wait or hang out at the Sushi Bar.< /Text>

This is our new favorite restaurant. Wide-ranging menu with many items if you're not a Ramen Eater. Great food/prices/staff. Open daily till 1AM. Kitchen may close by 12:30AM. Usually easy parking and fast service. Several other restaurants and Starbucks in the same parking lot.</review>

<review>I'm giving this place a 3 out of pure optimism. The restaurant is small, clean, and pleasant. The staff was friendly, attentive, and the service was prompt. That said, I cannot say good things about the ramen. I got the Chashu ramen because chashu, when done correctly, is a real treat. But the chashu I was served was WOEFULLY DRY. And I mean TOUGH. The shoyu broth was little more than boullion from a Maruchan packet. I cant speak to the rest of the menu, but the ramen was a hard pass. Pity. The search for great ramen in the valley continues.</review>< pics>

I have been coming here for years! Me and my husband have become regulars and we always get great service! This place can get very busy yet the food always comes out in rapid speed! The best ramen in the valley and the prices can't be beat! 5 stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</review>

< Review>
Used to be a regular customer there, but recently their service has gone downhill like a snowball. Today when I walked in, was immediately greeted by a "please wait here to be seated" sign with an added sticker says "OK?". Sounds like someone is inpatient here but fine....So I waited with one other gentlemen before me. We stood there for 5 minutes and the waiters passing by just looked at us and never said a word, not even simple things like "be right with you in a sec". There were empty tables right in front of us but nope, all the waiters just attend other matters and gave you this expression that they don't give a fk. Definitely the worst service I've ever seen in a restaurant.<//Review>

The last place you would look for an establishment that offer friendly staff, a fun atmosphere, and fun sushi. I hope just because I rate it highly, it doesn't get too popular.

Sometimes a long wait around dinnertime but well worth it. Nice dark atmosphere where it's easy to get lost in the flavor of the food. They have my favorite beer too (asahi!)<//review>

This Place is good when looking for something near(the valley). They have an ample variety of plates to choose from. I am forced to give them 1 star(would've given it 5) but there's a waitress whom aside from barely speaking comprehensible english, has such a negative attitude... She will ask you what you'd like and as soon as you begin, she quickly gives you a look and tells you to give her a second because she's overwhelmed with her order device. So you feel like you did something wrong(her remarks and annoyed facial expressions). The thing of it all is that, you are barely able to understand her and she's the one with the short temper. She only smiles and laughs with her co-workers but not with the clientele(the irony)... Nonetheless  the food is good and price is reasonable. Will still recommend because it's tasty food.

************UPDATE JAN. 2019**********
This place STILL continues to have poor service... From the moment you arrive, and stand there waiting for one of the staff to acknowledge you, to the end of your visit. They will pass you and look the other way, so they won't have to make eye contact. When you kindly ask for napkins, fork, soy sauce, etc, they are over the top rude. They roll their eyes. Look at you/talk to you as if you are wasting their time. It's baffling... I was laughing yesterday because I find it  incredible how people in this type of environment, have the courage to comport themselves in this manner. There are only 2 waiters that are really nice and just plain friendly. They totally have what it takes to tend to customers. The only issue is that they aren't always there. So, because their food is good and local, we have been tolerating their rudeness.
They SERIOUSLY need to check their attitude.</review>

<text>Very good food. Me and my family came here for the first time. There is a waiting line to be seated but we were seated fast. Also as soon as we sat down we were approached and had our order ready withing 10 mins of sitting. All the employees were professional and nice. I will definitely be returning. The ramen was amazing!!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

<Review>The food was just ok. The curry and Ramen was watered down. The salmon roe was basic. I'm guessing I just didn't order the right things becuase I asked a friend about this place after eating and they said I should have gotten the udon. 2 stars for the food and an extra star for the prices. It's an alright place if you're tight on money but I wouldn't expect an authentic flavor from here. My friend agreed with me on the flavor and she's Japanese so I'm pretty convinced it wasn't just me.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOR-NUfFf4lq7bYgUTu2UihvLK2nNoFwpNfkKJZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

Food wasn't as good as I remember it to be. The rice around the sushi rolls were hard and would fall apart. Ordered dessert and I had to wait a very long time for it to not even be as good as I thought it would plus the raseberrys used to garnish it were old soggy. I remember it being better couple months ago, I'm dissappointed.</review>

Really solid prices on food and offers cool lunch and dinner specials depending on what time you arrive. They also offer pitchers of beer if you're with friends. They have a dedicated sushi bar as well so that you can order sushi AND ramen if you wanted. Tastes great all around and has good prices for the portions.< /text>

please be aware that they have an online menu with prices (only the restaurant can post these prices). When I called to place the order, their prices were different; and much more expensive. I explained I am looking at their pricing on online. They got defensive, argued with me and I just moved on somewhere else. Please get your prices straight and stop deceiving. Rather than honoring, you were arguing.</Review>

I love this place. I've been coming here since it opened and they had the menu as pictures of ducks and pigs on the walls. Get the fried rice, it's the best I've ever had. I love that you can now get sushi as well. For a few years the service was terrible here, but it has improved significantly and I'm back to being a regular here.<//text>

<text>I'm a pretty regular customer. I bring friends here all the time. I love the food and the atmosphere here. But today, I came in for a nice relaxing lunch after a stressful morning, and the people next to me were painting their toenails! Gross!< /text></record></dataset><record>
<Text>The food is absolutely amazing and totally worth it however the experience with the staff I have had has been subpar at best. Both times I have been here we're for take out and the staff is really quiet spoken and not really so much ready to help. Maybe if you are sitting you might have a better experience than I have. Either way the food and their hours is what saves it overall and keeps this at a solid 4 stars</Text>< Date>

Recommend: the house ramen and katsu curry. The sushi here is always good. Particularly love the SoCal roll.
I could wax poetic about the service or the atmosphere but just try out some of the menu items and enjoy. The food speaks for itself. And there is so much good food to choose from.< /Text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>Come in between 5-8 and they have a sick deal - a full bowl of ramen, mini rice bowl, and a large beer to wash it down with for under $15.  If that's not a steal, I don't know what is!

This is one of my favorite Ramen shops.  I absolutely LOVE the rice bowls.  Tasty, filling, and not super expensive either.  If it's been a long day at work and you want a hot meal, stop in and say hello.  They'll serve you with old school palm pilots (for real), and give you some good grub.

I'll admit, the service could be a bit better, but this isn't a bad place to just hang out with friends. It's worth the slow service to eat here. As far as the price goes, it's much cheaper than your average Japanese restaurant in LA. The value you get here is much higher than what you would expect in the rest of Los Angeles.<//Review>< Response>

Didn’t bother to eat there— we asked the staff to change our table so we don’t sit next to the bathroom and in the middle of heavy foot traffic, staff told us to go back to the end of the line to wait. Rude service.</Text>

The ramen was good for the price. But the service was bad. We order side dishes without onions, specifically requested no onions on anything in our order.

They brought out our ramen first, then we get to the end of our bowls without our side dishes coming out. At this point plenty of other patrons had gotten their sides and ramen.

I politely notify the waitress that our sides have not arrived. She goes to check up on them. Thankfully within a few minutes our first dish arrives... With onions all over it.

I let the server know that we had ordered it without, he takes it back. A few minutes later they bring the dish back without onions. I start moving the grilled meat around and there are onions that had slipped through the crevices.

So they basically took my food back and cleared the visible onions but still give me the dish that was covered in onions.

I asked the waitress to cancel the side dishes and just bring us the check.

I was very disappointed by this experienced... especially since this place is so highly rated.</text>

<Review>Definitely a most go if you haven't had a moment to go. Miso spicy Ramen was just delicious. It made me satisfied and I enjoyed it all. It had a great touch of spicyness and the flavors were just perfectly balanced. The place is really nice on Mondays around 10pm. Also if you plan on going I heard that on the weekends this place gets packed. So make sure to go from Monday thru Thursday. And what I loved about this place is that is closed at 1am. So time is not an issue.</Review><Date>1554791276784</Date><resp>None<//resp>< username>

<Text>I'm giving a four star because the server Michelle was super nice, and helpful and all in all seemed like an awesome person. I ordered the spicy deluxe ramen. I am a little disappointed because it's not very spicy, the noodles were al dente, the meat was bland, and the egg was definitely overcooked. All in all good experience but I wouldn't come back for the ramen. Michelle's service made up for the ramen that is for sure<//Text>< pictures>

Busy, busy, busy. The service here is terrible, but the food is FANTASTIC. If you don't care about being served and you're all about the food, then this is the spot for you. If you're even a little bit arrogant, then don't bother. You'll be too annoyed to enjoy the food. That's my honest review.< /Review>

<Review>Been going here for years, it seems they got a new owner.  Meat portion in the ramen (both chicken and pork) are small compared to before.  The sushi side of the restaurant has a lounge feel to it, low lights and loud music.  Thing that were not there before.  I saw a few families trying to have dinner with their children and loud music playing in the dinning room, looked and felt strange.  I guess it time for me to find a new ramen spot.<//Review>< pics>

I give the food a 5 stars and the service a one star if that. Horrible service, great food. They need to re staff their waiters.< /Review>

<Text>Only one vegan options all the other ramen you couldn't even substitute cause they make them in batches and serve them and already have beef broth. It's really easy to make ramen vegan they should have at least one other option for a vegetable broth bas soup. Plus the server was super rude I didn't get his name but he's tall really skinny young and Asian. Most of there menu you can't even buy till after 5 pm so annoying!< /Text>< Rating>

<review>My favorite ramen joint, hands down. Cozy atmosphere. Never too crowded except on weekend nights. Food is top notch and so is the beer. Highly recommended. If you enjoy some good ramen at a good price especially for the hearty amount they give you, then you have found a more-than-just-good spot. Check it out.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Great food, but the service was pretty awful last night. Waited for a table for over 30 min (could visibly see open tables/booths), then waited an over an hour to receive one roll of sushi and steamed gyoza..  waitress was very scattered, inattentive, and would leave as we were speaking with her or trying to order. Watched a group that sat down 5-10 min after us get their food before our table.< /Text>

The fact that this place closes at 12am is great! Atleast for me..the Spicy Ramen is my usual except I get the bean sprouts on the side for precaution of their cleanliness. All things aside the food can be a hit or miss but the prices are reasonable.</review>

Kyushu is that hole in the wall type of place you find when trying to find a restaurant that's open past midnight.

Servers are always friendly, variety is good, and it's pretty well priced. Wait times are sometimes an issue because lines do amass on weekends and Fridays, but dining wait times aren't bad at all.

Their ramen, takoyaki, katsu, and sushi are all great. The Hanabishi box and sushi boat are gimmicky orders but they are worth the price you pay for the amount of food and experience you get in my opinion.

I've never had any bad experiences there. Definitely recommend to anyone, especially late night diners.<//text>

<Review>I went here tonight for the first time. Good hosts but the place is very small. You are basically shoulder to shoulder with the people to the next table. They have a sushi bar there as well that takes up a lot of room. The place is divided by a wall. One side, where the entrance is located, has table booths more suitable for privacy and chat with friends, up to 4 people. It has a wall in between which divides the sushi bar and these booth tables. The area with the sushi bar has two people tables so you are forced to sit in front of the person you are with. I went here with my girl friend and I enjoy sitting next to her rather then in front. In addition to the sitting arrangements, the food was decent. I ordered Spicy pork ramen which took my taste buds a minute to get use to. I was not able to figure out this flavor I kept on tasting with ever zip of the spicy broth. The noodles where very chewy and the texture of doe was really out there. Pork was soft but all together it created a flavor I was not to fond of. In conclusion, i do recommend this place if you want a quick bite of either sushi or ramen. They have a variety of liquor, which am sure would of made me enjoy the place a lot more if I drank a bottle to myself. Good luck and enjoy.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

They do not use slow cooked pork broth it seems. Might be chicken. It's missing the richness of 12hr+ pork bone broth. I would go back though. Cant beat the value of the sushi. The van nuys roll goes down so easy.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>This place really has the best ramen for the best prices in the valley, it also serves beer which is a step up from on the places on Ventura blvd that don't have their liquor license. The service here is really bad almost 97% of the time. But the food makes it worth it. Spicy ramen, sushi, and a cold beer. Can't expect much more.<//Text>< pics>

I was really craving ramen so I decided to bring my family here everything was great we were having such a good time had a good waiter next thing you know the honest had to ruin everything by being so rude. This ruined everything about this place sadly how one free member has to make the whole business look bad. Never experience a employee screaming at a customer. Never again.<//text>

<review>Seriously had an awful time here , I’ve been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years and am disappointed in the service I received from the moment I walked in. Me and my husband had to wait a long time before anyone asked us about our drinks and our order. The waitress “mookie” was very rude and seemed like she didn’t care to help us. We ordered 2 rainbow rolls and a Sapporo , 45 mins later we finally got our rolls and the soy sauce bottle on our table was empty ,we asked  the waiter that brought our rolls if he could get us some soy sauce , he never came back with anything my husband had to get up and ask the waiter and he just told him to “wait bro I’m working two sides, I’ll get it to you right now” so my husband asked for a refund since he didn’t eat anything and the service was terrible as well as the miso soup we got was watered down. The sushi was getting warm since they had the heater running too. The waitress had a horrible attitude throughout the whole thing never gave us any napkins and never checked on us by then my husband had enough he had to get up to ask for the check and  his refund for the roll he never ate, the waitress had called the sushi manager on the other side (Hanabishi Sushi) and basically lied about her bad service as he argued with my husband saying “my people don’t do that” “your wrong”! Super rude manager as he didn’t want to hear it. Really went out tonight to have a good time with my husband and eat some good food but will definitely not be coming back here as it was such a bad experience tonight. Hope they get it together since the food is good but overall customer service and a lot of other things are just bad.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
On the day we stopped at Kyushu Ramen... I had a major craving for ramen. Kyushu was a restaurant that is hidden in the San Fernando Valley area. It is a small place with no major catching signs. When we arrived there was a line which to me was a great sign. We waited around 15 minutes for a table of three which was surprisingly fast. When we entered the restaurant it felt very lively, but crowded. Kyushu has a great menu of sushi and ramen. Because of my craving for ramen I only choose ramen. It was the bomb! The broth was delicious and very memorable for me. I have saved Kyushu's location on my google map so when I am in town... i will surely visit it again.</Review>

Been around for sometime over 25 years for sure. And the owner of this place is originally from Japan and his father owned restaurant in Tokyo. Awesome food and the sushi bar (izakaya) is the same owner and you can go to either restaurant to enjoy all food! 1 of the people's choice entree is "chicken karaage" dinner. And its open late and last order is like at 11pm on daily basis. Great place!</text>

Really great ramen as we go here often. Just know wait times can be long. Also, when theyre busy, dont expect staff to check on you too often as youll need to flag/wave them down.</review>

<review>The people were very rude and the hostess was on her phone while we waited to be served. After an agonizing wait we were finally seated but but they never led us to a table so we sat ourselves. They then asked us to move to a different table and we weren't served for a while. A server finally came but he was going back and forth not giving us a chance to order. They were looking at with very strange looks. Bad service and no Dr. Pepper! One star by far.< /review><GmapID>0x80c29746bae330d3:0x8191e11ecfc0a503< /GmapID>< Rating>

I've been coming here for the past 3 years... and never have I experience racial favoritism in such a rude and straightforward way until today!!! 😨😱😳😵
As I am already aware, this place always gets packed! Which explains the sucky service at times. They have a sign-up sheet for seating outside... and I understand they try accommodating the best seating for each party. BUT WHYYY the heck was there a need to ask if someone was "Thai" in order to give you a seat is BEYOND me!!!
I was the next person on the list and got skipped over because the next person was "Thai" and spoke Tagalog! Really?!?!?
And NO... her party wasn't bigger or smaller than mine! We both would have fit in a 2-person table. SMH!
So with that being said... feel prepared to feel ignored or dismissed NOW if you're not "their people" - I suppose! 🤔<//Text>

I was really craving ramen so I decided to bring my family here everything was great we were having such a good time had a good waiter next thing you know the honest had to ruin everything by being so rude. This ruined everything about this place sadly how one free member has to make the whole business look bad. Never experience a employee screaming at a customer. Never again.< /review>

I ordered a spicy tuna rice bowl, it tasted like a mixture of old tuna and mayo. It literally looked like cat food. I asked to have something different and was told it was "fresh" and they would not replace it.

As far as the ramen goes, you'd be much better going to Urban Ramen or Silverlake Ramen... places that actually slow cook their pork broth (actually have pork broth for that matter).</Text>

<Text>We had to flag one of the servers down after waiting for menus for 10 minutes. Then we waited 30 minutes for our orders to be taken while a man next to us was seated right away and had his order taken within 5 minutes. The servers just kept walking past us. Terrible service.< /Text>< pics>

HAIR IN FOOD - HORRIBLE SERVICE - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This restaurant has really taken a nose dive in their service and quality of food ... will never return here again.  Few months ago we ordered the Hanabishi box, when my honey took a bite of the tempura shrimp, he had to pull out a Looooong black hair from his throat that he almost swallowed ... we were totally disgusted but we managed to eat the rest of our dinner carefully...the waitress apologized and gave us a small discount.  Then tonight we decided to give it another try... this was a huge mistake.  We arrived on Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. and there was a sign by the door that says Please Wait to Be Seated... so we stood by the sign for more than 10 minutes and nobody greeted us.  We finally caught the attention of one waitress and she told us to go outside and put our names on the list.  We explained we have been waiting by the sign and nobody told us about a list.  She rudely tells us that's how it is, everybody knows this.  We asked her if it's possible to be seated at a booth, she says write "booth" next to our name when we write it down on the list. So ok, we waited some more, then finally we were seated to a table right next to the front door, the booth right next to us became available and we asked if it's possible to be seated there and she told us, if we want to move to another table we have to put our name on the list again and wait again for our turn.  Then 3 booths all opened up and she still would not let us move without starting the whole process all over again.  This was utterly ridiculous - she said sorry it's our policy.  We ordered the Hanabishi box again, she never brought us a spoon for our soup, then they completely left out the shrimp tempura.  So we waived the lady who brought our food to us and mentioned that there is supposed to be shrimp tempura with this dish, she said she will check the menu. She brings me the menu to let me know it doesn't come with it, but we pointed out that the photo clearly shows two shrimp tempura, so she said she will check with the manager.  Finally, another lady brought two measly shrimp tempura.  The salad was wilty and warm, the soup was cold, the tempura was cold... Also the table where we sat there was a glaring white light right in our eyes, we mentioned this to our waitress and she told us to move to the hard chairs on the other side of the table instead of the bench we were sitting on so we don't have to see the bright light. She said she will turn down the lights - but she never did.  Also when people were seated to the booth next to us, the whole bench was rocking and creaking, and the guy sitting next to me couldn't stop shaking his legs, so we were also bouncing on our bench.  This was one of the worst dining experience, so now we didn't have hair in our food but everything else was truly TERRIBLE!   GO SOMEWHERE ELSE if you want an enjoyable dining experience with better service and food.< /review>

Visited here while in the area. It had a high rating and appeared to be good. My coworker had pho and I had spicy ramen . I'm glad I had the spicy style. If packed a flavor punch. I felt like the combo ramen I got hit the mark in terms of flavor and and amount of meat. I felt like over all the soup and the noodles were excellent. The service was fast and attentive although not very much in the way of talking up the pho over ramen options. I'd be back if I werw in the area.< /Text>

Best ramen in town as far as I'm concerned! The ramen is spot on and beautifully served, as is the food which is great. The sushi is also very good. The atmosphere is indeed very cozy and nicely decorated and allows for a comfortable experience. The service is good too, the servers are very kind. The place becomes very busy at times, but the wait is always worth it. If you're looking for a good experience and excellent traditional Japanese food, Kyushu is one of the best places to go!<//text>

I’ve been there plenty of times, the ramen is very good. It’s not NYC Totto Ramen good, which is why this isn’t a 5 star review, but that’s the bar for ramen for us. Broth is always flavorful, noodles are well-cooked (meaning, not mushy or over-cooked). I order extra pork because I like a heartier bowl. The appetizers we’ve had are mostly pork belly bao, and the popcorn shrimp. The service is always good and friendly. An excellent addition to the Stamford restaurant scene!< /review>

<text>Though their vegetarian/vegan options (especially before 5pm) are fairly limited (not a huge surprise, but would be nice to offer at least a couple of main dish options), the vegan ramen is surprisingly good with a nicely creamy broth.<//text>< Pictures>

Last time I ate there I paid them with my Wells Fargo Visa Debit Card. A Young man took my card & I had to remind him to give it back, ever since then I had to replace it with a new one. I'm sure they Jacked me & doubled charged me. Very disrespectful, even though I tipped them $ 10 with a roll of quarters I had withdrawn from Wells Fargo Bank I also lost my Smartphone, & MPCS Account. Was Lost because of Unfriendly Customer Service. They never cared for me, because they know I'm USA Citizen, Native American Indian !  🇺🇸🦅 Those individuals are still working there, most probable still scheming & scaming. Bad Place to eat Good Japanese Cusine! I still have my receipt, my debit card I used & My MPCS Smartphone! 🏜️🏆🏅🥊</Text>

Hands down, best ramen in town.  Top that with their scrumptious endamame and finish it off with their sashimi platter and you have the whole spectrum of delight, wander and awe at your fingertips, quite literally, the beginning of the end.  A warm meal alongside a cold serving of generous portions of Toro.  It's how the last meal might taste like: melt in your mouth, mouth-watering goodness over volcanic subtlies.<//Review>

<Review>Owners must have changed. Not a great experience as it once was. We ordered Vege Ramen with no tomato because my Fiancé is extremely allergic. I emphasized this twice as well. She repeated to me. "Yeah I got it." I ordered the beef short ribs. The size of the meals to me got WAY smaller than they were before. Ramen came with tomato. Then the manager came out to argue over the fact that we didn't mention anything to the server. Our server lied to her manager telling her we mentioned nothing to her. Also. People who were seated 15 after us. Got thier food before we did. Lmao. Not going back here anytime soon. We waited 30 mins to get food that wasn't prepared correctly and argue over he said she said bs. Stay away.<//Review>< Rate>

<text>I been a regular at this place for a long time. It's usually busy and the food is great but the customers service is really lacking. Today was the last straw I usually go with my girl and two waitresses already know us  and are super nice since we are always here. Today I came by my self and I waited 40 plus min for just me, and when I go and check on the sign in sheet two couple walk by my and are escorted to a table like I wasn't waiting for 40 damn mins. And to add onto it I then wait 15 min more to be called, so when I do finally get called I wanna sit in a booth and I get dismissed and they wanna seat me in a place that I know gets a lot of traffic because of the bathroom. I also know this because I AM A REGULAR. I'm pretty sure the waitress that dismissed me is a racist, ever since I started coming here she always has had that additude with anyone that is no Asian trust me all my friends and family have notic. But whatever they lost a loyal customer today, never coming back again.

Update: 5/30/2018 pretty weird after I reviewed this place the waitress that was being rude was let go. Only reason I found out was because my brother would still go to this restaurant and he let me know that the owner spoke to her about all the complaints he was getting about her. I have gone back since then and it's way better now since some of the waitresses have been replaced.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>HAIR IN FOOD - HORRIBLE SERVICE - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This restaurant has really taken a nose dive in their service and quality of food ... will never return here again.  Few months ago we ordered the Hanabishi box, when my honey took a bite of the tempura shrimp, he had to pull out a Looooong black hair from his throat that he almost swallowed ... we were totally disgusted but we managed to eat the rest of our dinner carefully...the waitress apologized and gave us a small discount.  Then tonight we decided to give it another try... this was a huge mistake.  We arrived on Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. and there was a sign by the door that says Please Wait to Be Seated... so we stood by the sign for more than 10 minutes and nobody greeted us.  We finally caught the attention of one waitress and she told us to go outside and put our names on the list.  We explained we have been waiting by the sign and nobody told us about a list.  She rudely tells us that's how it is, everybody knows this.  We asked her if it's possible to be seated at a booth, she says write "booth" next to our name when we write it down on the list. So ok, we waited some more, then finally we were seated to a table right next to the front door, the booth right next to us became available and we asked if it's possible to be seated there and she told us, if we want to move to another table we have to put our name on the list again and wait again for our turn.  Then 3 booths all opened up and she still would not let us move without starting the whole process all over again.  This was utterly ridiculous - she said sorry it's our policy.  We ordered the Hanabishi box again, she never brought us a spoon for our soup, then they completely left out the shrimp tempura.  So we waived the lady who brought our food to us and mentioned that there is supposed to be shrimp tempura with this dish, she said she will check the menu. She brings me the menu to let me know it doesn't come with it, but we pointed out that the photo clearly shows two shrimp tempura, so she said she will check with the manager.  Finally, another lady brought two measly shrimp tempura.  The salad was wilty and warm, the soup was cold, the tempura was cold... Also the table where we sat there was a glaring white light right in our eyes, we mentioned this to our waitress and she told us to move to the hard chairs on the other side of the table instead of the bench we were sitting on so we don't have to see the bright light. She said she will turn down the lights - but she never did.  Also when people were seated to the booth next to us, the whole bench was rocking and creaking, and the guy sitting next to me couldn't stop shaking his legs, so we were also bouncing on our bench.  This was one of the worst dining experience, so now we didn't have hair in our food but everything else was truly TERRIBLE!   GO SOMEWHERE ELSE if you want an enjoyable dining experience with better service and food.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I eat here all the time and have seen the quality slowly drop over the years. I just ordered the BBQ ribs today and most of the ribs had little to no meat on it. This was the last straw :(< /Review>

Still the best. Definitely get the Special - spicy miso ramen - there are pictures on the walls to help you remember. Pair with a large Asahi and you're good to go.</review>

I got the Kyushu ramen which has a tonkatsu soup base, it was pretty good (: my ramen came fairly quickly, but my friend who got a bento box didn't get it until I was halfway done.. And this is one of the few places that actually has okonomiyaki!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Love kyushu ramen, best sushi place and ramen house. Lots of menu items, i would recommend it to any one.. It gets packed lots of people visit closes late. Come during lunch hour. And happy hour you can save a few bucks i been coming here for years hasn't really change much, consistency is key and kyushu has it dead on. I always do birthdays here and graduations, also celebration. The server's are nice people i like there positive attitude, the atmosphere is great feels like im in japan. During lunch hour the sushi rolls are crazy good salmon roll, van nuys roll the bomb.<//Review><rate>5</rate>< date>

OYAKO DON SAMA!  I LOVE YOU!  Seriously, the chicken and egg over rice bowl here is amazing. It's almost on par with the one at Daikokuya.  Except it's a tad smaller but still oh so delicious. The cutlet curry is also delicious and the gyoza are your typical pork or chicken affair.  The prices are extremely reasonable.

The wait staff are polite, courteous and very professional.

Definitely eat here!<//Review>

Little ramen place in a strip mall off of Sherman.  Restaurant is two different restaurants that are connected.  One half does ramen and some other stuff.  The other half does sushi and other different stuff.  There are two separate menus.  The ramen half is open more hours than the other half, so some times you can only order off the ramen-half menu.  The rest of the time, you can order off of either menu (or both), regardless of where you're sitting.  The ramen is decent.  The sushi is average.  Not really worth ordering unless you have a deep craving and can't make it anywhere better.  Decent to good cutlet curry.  Terriyaki is okay.<//Text>

<Text>Waited a good 20 minutes because we based it off the reviews so why not try it out? Get there, they take forever. Food was horrible, ordered chicken curry ramen and some other ramen? Whatever it was tasted like cup of noddles or something. The teriyaki rice and shrimp balls were good but if you want ramen, don't come here. I payed for 2 full bowls of soup untouched.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

It was my first time eating ramen and I loved it. I had the miso ramen and it didn't take long to get to me. It came hot and freaking goood!!! (Trust me, I cook) my only disapointment was that there was only one pork slice. Also, they have a whole wall of sake if you're into that.</Review>

<text>Only ramen place open after 10pm and so far I'm not impressed. Made our order at about 11pm, ramen and three types of sushi. Ramen gets here in about 15mins, and none of the sushi got to us until AFTER 45 MINUTES! yeah its busy alot of people who came after got their orders which was really irritating. To top it off, the ramen tastes like the pork top ramen I make at home >.> the older server lady though was nice and the only one apologizing and on top of whoever kept giving our order to other people.

Not the best experience, so I might not come back here again. I'll stick with crazy rock'n sushi next time.</text><Rating>2</Rating><UserId.>106622628759320300377<//UserId.>< Pics>

I would have given this place four stars except for the service, which was abysmally slow, despite not having that many customers. Also there were a bunch of things crossed off the menu, which was annoying. Just print out a new menu, then!

Otherwise, the ramen itself was delicious. We had the mapo ramen and the ja-jen ramen, as well as the karaage chicken combo. They were all pretty good.<//text>

Barely talked to me and even left me talking to myself once when I was still in the middle of asking them something about my order. The sushi was so pricey and such little quantity, they even stuff their regular sushi with Wasabi without telling you so when I took a bite my mouth was covered in it and could not eat second piece which made it a waste of 5 dollars for two small pieces of sushi. Will not go back again< /Review></record>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) A store that I have known for over 20 years.
For a few years now, I lost my charm and stopped going.
The other day I went after a long absence and I felt something was delicious.
I will go again.

(Original)
20年以上前から知っているお店です。
数年前から魅力が無くなり、行かなくなりました。
先日に久しぶりに行ったらなんか美味しくなってる気がしました。
また行きます。</Review>
