This is my local go to pizza spot. I’ve been coming here for eighteen years because the food is great and the owner and employees go out of their way to make you feel welcome.
And, if you are just driving through town to someplace else it’s a wonderful place to grab a bite too. Oh, also, very kid friendly with the arcade and pool table.<//Review>

This is the best pizza ever!  We have been coming here since 2008!  The garlic butter sauce is my fav and regular sauce my husband's.  Never soggy!  Although I do get extra crisp crust.<//Review>

The owner was super nice and the pizza was pretty good. There are other options if you do not want pizza. I have been looking for a new pizza since my favorite place closed for business. I think this will be my new place.</Text>

{'time': 1553970194232, 'text': 'Pablo, thanks for taking your time to review us! If it was the matter of accusations without proof then your review is valid. However since we have multiple records of you not picking up your pizza (the multiple tags of you calling in and placing orders under different names)  we unfortunately do have the right to refuse your service. Customer service is from both ends the vendor AND the consumer and if the consumer actions are such (in this case your negligence of as a customer of not picking up food) we act accordingly. We apologize for the mishap.'}<//Resp>

Just about done with this place.
Keeps accusing me of calling in an order and then not picking it up, why would I keep coming back to a place that I like or do anything to hurt the business, they keep saying the numbers are the same and that I use different names, my name is Pablo/Paul, not that hard to listen. Then she gives out her pity story about her own personal problems. I’m not coming back anymore especially if they lack customer service, they lost a customer to an already dead location, great job on this.</review>

This place is addicting, asked the owner if they put coke in the pizza, she says no, but at 2am almost every morning when I’m literally itching for it.... I don’t believe her.< /review>

<text>It’s a good place to live. It’s very quiet, my window faced the courtyard so I woke up to the sound of the water fountain, it felt peaceful. Maintenance was always on time and they are really nice, also the management team (Zoey and Ana) are cool and helped when I had an issue.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Zoey and Ana are really helpful and made my transition very smooth. They were very prompt in answering my questions on time and maintenance on time.

4 stars because of no move-in specials :( and I guess it is very old building so sometimes I hear noises from the floor above. But overall everything is good so far.< /Text>

<Text>I live here and love it! The apartments are very clean and look nice. They've been remodeled to look modern and there's a beautiful courtyard for everyone to enjoy. Management is very accommodating and maintenance is super quick. Best place to live in the area by far and it's reasonably priced!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

It’s a good place to live. It’s very quiet, my window faced the courtyard so I woke up to the sound of the water fountain, it felt peaceful. Maintenance was always on time and they are really nice, also the management team (Zoey and Ana) are cool and helped when I had an issue.<//Text>

< review>
Zoey and Ana are really helpful and made my transition very smooth. They were very prompt in answering my questions on time and maintenance on time.

4 stars because of no move-in specials :( and I guess it is very old building so sometimes I hear noises from the floor above. But overall everything is good so far.<//review>

<review>I live here and love it! The apartments are very clean and look nice. They've been remodeled to look modern and there's a beautiful courtyard for everyone to enjoy. Management is very accommodating and maintenance is super quick. Best place to live in the area by far and it's reasonably priced!</review>< pictures>

I walked in today for the first time in years and remembered why I don’t shop there. It’s super crowded and you can’t walk around without knocking stuff. Fitting rooms joke... no lights, hot and they are locked. Why hasn’t this place been remodeled???< /Review>

I like shopping their but they are really disrespectful one of the women with blonde hair had been watching my friend very closely like if she was gonna steal something then at the end when we got out the women that works there had made a face to her and we didn't even know her then my friend started being nice since we don't like hurting people but then she started being awful to us and told us if she really wanted us band then there was this big group of my friends behind me we started roasting her I didn't mean to hurt her mentally but she had it coming and this are they kind of people in this world that don't deserve respect because the don't reflect it on us they are a bad influence on kind people< /text>

<review>I got a cleaning here the other day and had a great experience! Dr Hakim was very friendly and welcoming. 😄 I have braces, but even then Shima cleaned my teeth SO WELL! She made sure to make me feel comfortable and was super outgoing. The staff is amazing and everyone is so kind, 10/10 would recommend coming here. 👍🏽<//review>< pics>

<username>Maria Foster</username><review>Dr. Hakim is an amazing dentist.  I went in a year ago for veneer that had cracked off.  I was freaking out because when I had it done, it took weeks to fit it, have it made and "installed".  She saw me the next day, placed a temp as it was the Friday before Thanksgiving and assured me when I came back a week later it would be done in a day.  I have a phobia of dentists and usually only do sedation dentistry but agreed because she could do this in a day.  When I went back in she was true to her word, she got my temp off, got what was left of the veneer off, fitted me for a new veneer, had it made in her office and placed in one afternoon and I was good to go.  A year and some change later, I finally had the nerve to go back in this week and get the rest of my work done.  I needed some crown overlays and a cavity on a canine done.  To my surprise, I did all of this without nitrous (I realized this about 75% of the way through my second visit).  I felt no pain except on one of the worst cavities and I'm finishing the rest of my work in two weeks.  This will be the first time in my adult life I plan to go to regular cleanings and keep up with my dental work rather than hold off as long as possible and pay for sedation dentistry.  Dr. Hakim has a gentle beside manner and her technique for numbing you is  amazing.  She has the best technology and the work is so efficient.  I drive from the south bay to see her because she is that good!</review></record>

Dr. Hakim and her staff are professional, friendly and very efficient.   I broke a crown last week and Dr. Hakim saw me within 2 hours.  We agreed on a new crown 3 days later which is during Christmas week.  She fit me in, completed the entire procedure within 90 minutes including making the crown.  Her staff was so warm and empathetic.   I used to hate going to the dentist but I feel very safe and cared for here< /Review>

<Review>The vibe of Dr. Hakim is direct, cold, and unwelcoming. Generally speaking, my experiences here as a patient has turned me off to going to the dentist despite previously enjoying the dentist. Expect this office to cancel/move your appointments a day before your appointment. I've been called the day before my scheduled appointment asking me to drop everything and come in/change my appointment to accommodate their staff schedule. Dr. Hakim when working on your teeth is rough/not gentle and it seems that she does not give to much thought about patient comfort. One time I waited so long for Dr. Hakim that the numbing meds wore off, resulting excruciating pain but she eventually put more numbing meds on. After two years of giving them a chance, I'm finding a new dentist. Save yourself a headache or two and find a different dentist unless you like cancelled appointments/being forced to adjust your schedule within 24 hours of your appointment, and/or if you enjoy your mouth/teeth being tugged around and in pain.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1605549360107, 'text': 'Dear Genia\nI am very sorry if you had a bad experience, that is certainly not our intention.

While I personally enjoyed the staff and office, don’t be fooled. This group might try to fill a cavity that isn’t there or sell you a scan that you don’t need. Specifically, I was told that a scan was necessary for my wisdom teeth extraction. I have not been asked to pay a premium not covered by insurance at my new provider. I am someone who does only what is absolutely medically necessary. If you use this office, I would suggest seeking a second opinion before deciding on anything major. I’m glad that I did and I haven’t looked back.< /Review>

<Time>1359596598369</Time><review>I have been going to Dr. Hakim's office for the last few years.  Below are the reasons why I give it a 5 star review.

- Great staff:  Everyone knows your name and treats you with the utmost respect.  They are extremely knowledgeable and do great work.

- Quality of the work:  They do great work.  The hygienists are fantastic and are always thorough.

- The environment and equipment:  Their office is very nice.  They even have a crown creation machine in their office which means no temporary crowns of fillings.

-  Other:  There have been several items that they have done free of charge including, most recently, recasting and creating a new retainer for grinding (my last one broke).  This is something they offered right away.

Bottom line, I highly recommend this office.  I don't always give 5 star reviews, but Doctor Hakim's office greatly deserves it.< /review>< rating>

<Review>I visited Dr Hakim's dental office recently for a  root canal work and crown put in. Dr Hakim was very professional throughout the procedure, I was very pleased with the outcome. I recovered very quickly with no complications. I have subsequently returned for teeth cleaning and her hygienists were very gentle, all in all it was a terrific experience. I am normally nervous going to the dentists but this is a great office and I strongly recommend you go there for your dental needs. I give Dr Hakim's office a 5-star!< /Review><response>None</response>< pictures>

<text>Had my first appointment here last week, and the experience has been great!  Getting the appointment was an easy process, the staff was friendly and accommodating.  Dr Hakim was very personable and answered all of my questions.  The follow up work that was needed was clearly explained, and the staff even helped me make a plan of attack by walking me through exactly what charges would be covered under my insurance.  Would definitely recommend Extraordinary Smiles to anyone in need of routine or cosmetic dentistry.< /text>< user_name>

<Text>My dental hygienist is excellent every time!  Dr. Hakim does a great job as well.  Very high tech and thorough dental cleanings.  Easy online appointments.  Dona is a really helpful receptionist as well.  I have been going to Dr. Hakim almost 6 years.</Text>< rating>

<Review>Dr. Zahra Hakim is top notch! She knows I have some anxiety regarding dental visits and handles my appointments so that I'm as relaxed as I can be. My 4 hour appointment yesterday was pain-free and with great results. Throughout the work of 1 cap, fillings that needed replacing on 2 teeth and - the best part - 2 veneers, I felt well taken care of. I LOVE my 2 new front teeth. Everyone on the staff is superb - from #1 Donna, to her twin sister, and to Yoshiko, the wonderful hygienist.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Great experience!  Everyone was very friendly and nice.  They have a screen where you get to see your teeth via different cameras which I found very interesting.  They explained everything and all options very well, and were upfront and clear about what my insurance covered and didn't.  Overall great experience!<//Review>

Great dental office. First time there and the care was awesome! It's hard to find a good dental office, but this one is by far one of the best. I am looking forward to my future visits with this office. Their staff is very welcoming and super helpful.</Text>

This has been the absolute best care I have had from a dentist. The entire staff is very personable and I am always happy with my service...Dr. Hakim is very gentle and they are worth every penny I spend. I have had 5 dental providers since moving back to California. I had been very unhappy with the ones before now..I found out about this office on accident when I used to drive for Uber..I have been a client ever since...<//text>

I love the team here. Donna always provides great customer service and has remembered me from my first visit. I called today at 9:30am about a problematic tooth and they had me scheduled at 3:45pm. I arrived an hour early and they still saw me right away. They took care of it immediately and, so far, no more pain. I highly recommend Dr. Hakim.</text>

<text>I had as much of an enjoyable experience as possible at the dentist... Going to the dentist is never fun, but at this office, the dentist and staff are very nice and friendly - they do their best to make you feel as comfortable as possible. I had a few fillings redone, cleaning, and teeth whitening here, and every time I would give an 'Excellent' rating.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

They show you all the costs before any job is done. I highly recommend Dr. Hakim to others seeking dental health care.< /Review>< Date>

<Text>Great location--maybe the closest to the Stanford campus. Twice I found it easy to schedule an appointment for the next day. Wait time was short, and the hygienists were very friendly. When I got a small chip in my tooth, Dr. Hakim filled it well, and let me come in to talk with her another time when I had concerns about the health of me tooth. They seem to use the best tools available.</Text>< pics>

I'm extremely happy with my experience at Extraordinary Smile. Dr. Hakim is wonderful, and supported by an amazing staff. The office is well kept and presents an atmosphere of elegance but with a subtle amount of technology that reminds you that you're in a very professional establishment, it does show.

I'm amazed at how efficient Dr. Hakim and her staff were at performing some dental work (replaced a few fillings) as the entire procedure took no more than 45 mins - not enough time to get through an episode of Star Trek while watching a nice TV with Netflix that was offered to distract me from the procedure (they even had headphones)! This is another level of patient care that I really appreciated.

Scheduling at the front office has been great. They work with you and your schedule to make the best of your time and have been very nice about a a re-schedule I requested. The front desk has also been very good at calling in prescriptions to your local pharmacy without any issue.

I'm very happy to have found such a great dentist as we all know the search can be tedious. I look forward to the next visit as I know they'll take care of me!</Text>

<Text>After I had serious problems and pain in my teeth, I went to visit Dr. Hakim. She is very professional and treated my teeth very nice. I have no issues or problems now after a couple of months.

<text>This was a great vacation! All meals are paid for, the chow is great, and the chow hall staff couldn’t be better! The instructors are so nice and they teach you very well, they will also kindly help you with working out, it is definitely the most physically fit I’ve ever been! About 3/4 of they way through you get to take a trip and shoot rifles and go on nature walks, the walks do have some gentle slopes but nothing you couldn’t handle. At the very end you have the grand finale and you have a blast camping and hiking and you finish it off with an amazing breakfast!< /text><GmapID>0x80deaba419e6d5b5:0x991353ac0955b5de</GmapID><user_name>HTF Films</user_name>< pics>

<Text>I was stationed @ MCRD as a Corpsman in the early 90's. It was amazing to see the recruits enter as teenagers and leave as Marines! Oorah!!!

I have many memories of MCRD but what stood out the most...I would  request the graduating Marines to sing the Marine Corp hymn... Wow, always gave me goosebumps!</Text>< pics>

One of our greatest moments of family pride was watching our son graduate from Marine basic training. The events were expertly and honorably executed. The grounds are picturesque too.< /Review>

It's very crowded if you choose to visit during the summer, so plan accordingly. They like to say it all expenses paid but when read over the fine print you find out you paid extra for that package. The food is pretty good during your stay but you quickly realize that the decent variety of food was average at best after you leave. The lines at the restaurants and barbershops are extremely long but they go quicker than expected. Haircut options are very limited but you can upgrade your package with more options at no extra cost the longer you stay. A positive is the bedrooms are massive but the negative is you'll have to share with quite a few roommates. By far the best thing here is the fitness program. The staff are very motivated to constantly keep improving your physical fitness levels. They won't let you give up, they'll even provide extra individual workouts for you if you desire. The staff were a little to motivated for me. For some reason they felt like they had to yell all the time and they expect you to do the same, so that was kinda annoying. Overall my stay was more enjoyable than average. I originally gave a 3⭐ rating but while writing I realized it my stay was quite a bit better than my current stay, in Oceanside.</review>

I spent 3 months here. The employees are rather mean and make you move fast and scream loud.

They make you clean a lot.
They make you march perfectly.
They make you reminisce on this experience 14 years later at midnight in your bed and type a strange google review.
They make an 18 year old Homesick kid into a man.
They teach you to be proud of the uniform that you earn to wear.
They make you a Marine.

Thank you for having me stay over for the summer of 89’. You leave with a deep seeded appreciation for the different sounds of jet engines noise. During 1st phase watching the SeaWorld fireworks show every night from my rack was pretty cool. 🦅🌎⚓️</Review>

<review>Staff was very rude and yelled a lot. I had to share a room with several other people. Room service was terrible, I had to make my own bed. Food was terrible, but surprisingly there was always a very long line of people waiting to get in.

Definitely not coming back.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<review>Spent 13 weeks here in 2000. At that time, accommodations where very cramped, staff would give wake up calls an hour earlier than requested, no laundry service, I had to wash my clothes by hand, but they did supply soap and scrub brushes. Physical training center is huge and is open 24 hours a day. Beware of the managers easily recognized by the olive drab smokey bear and lage gold belt buckles, they were all very short tempered and seemed to not care how comfortable I was, however, did look out for my health checking that I was ok at least once every week we had health and wellness inspections. Transportation by bus readily available every 13th week but only seem to go to other Marine Corps locations.<//review><date>1597496290951<//date>< response>

Bring a jacket, charged phone, sunglasses, walking shoes(trust me the heels are cute but you'll regret them!), there are going to be kids at the graduation that don't have family members to show up so ask your marine if there are any people who need some company, DON'T WALK ON THE PLATFORM, watch your language and who you talk about again you will get your marine in trouble if their superiors find out, the oldest woman in your family group is allowed to hold onto the Marines LEFT arm(right is to be available at all times to salute) but everyone can have a turn after, there will be lots of tears 😁. Good luck and congrats you now have a Marine!!< /Text>< Time>

<text>Arrive at least an hour early. We sat in traffic for a half hour at Gate 5 only to then be pulled over for 100% vehicle inspection that took another 15 minutes. No one told us this and we missed most of the graduation. All they tell you is be seated by 9:45a but not to plan for long, long base access. Parking is very poor.< /text><Rate>2< /Rate>< response>

Amazing place!!! If you are going for graduation make sure you get there EARLY! At the gate you have your vehicle inspected and they check you with a metal detector. Make sure you have your I.D. Don't walk on the grass here or the parade deck.</text>

< Review>
I spent 13 heartfelt weeks here embellishing in the fine art of becoming a U.S Marine. A small group of well dressed men led me & my peers through various tests of intestinal fortitude while being served rations of culinary delicacies 3 times per day. The staff was very accommodating and even left a piece of candy on my pillow at naptime.< /Review>

<text>I stepped on these pair of yellow footprints here back in 1997...
I was met by a really excited, well dressed man who said his name was sir.  I think that might have been his last name and his first name might have been  Isaac or something because we all said I- Sir any time we spoke to him.

I stayed here for about 13 weeks, the mail service is spectacular but theres no wifi which I was disappointed. My room was very clean, i mean VERY clean but I had to share it with about 65 other males.

The wake up service was prompt and very loud, but very efficient.

We were assigned a guide who took us to various parts of the property. They have strict standards so when our original was not up to parr, he was quickly replaced.

This was an all inclusive property so we enjoyed three very nice meals a day but I guess I didnt get the all inclusive drink package because there was no soda and no alcoholic beverages all though I had all the water I could drink and it came in a cool green canteen.  I guess they are very water conscious and didnt want to waste any because at the end of the night we had to drink our entire canteen and then hold it out above our heads.

The gym here is FANTASIC, great athletic director.  They have a very elaborate adult jungle gym. For more of a botique style environment they have a small area that is part exercise facility, part exfoliation called the Sand Pit.  I spent many many hours here, again with several of my very enthusiastic nicely dressed hosts.

They also have a great offsite shooting range.

If you are staying here for a while I highly recommend the hiking trail called The Grim Reaper, lovely views and a very memorable experience.

For anyone still reading this review I highly recommend coming here and trying it out for yourself. It is sure to be a very memorable experience.  You will probably, like me, spend the rest of your life reminiscing about your stay here.

I got to enjoy rappelling down a tower with rope. The best part? They offer free haircuts and did I mention free food? Housing is free and they even PAY for you to be there. The little souvenir shop was a little disappointing but that's no penalty for a free resort stay in Sunny San Diego. They also have a nice pool.< /Text>< pictures>

Food was good, the gym was nasty and the beds were lumpy. The host was always yelling at the guest and the wake up calls or way too early. But for an all-expense-paid 3 month Southern California vacation it was well worth it. Class of 10-26-88 Semper Fi<//review>

I lived there for three months back in '93. The weather is awesome all year round as I have visited the area a couple times since at various times. Being right next to the runway of an international airport is not as bad as you would think. When it was time to catch some sleep I really didn't notice the air traffic. I would recommend anybody with the fortitude to enjoy a standard stay of thirteen weeks.</Text>

Prior to my delayed boot camp graduation ( I had an extended hospital stay with scarlet fever), I managed to see that Staff Sgt Taylor assessed me as “defiant” & a “sick bay commando.”

Went here for a bit of R & R after a stressful 13 years of school.  Great place to go if you are down for fun filled activities on a daily basis, whether rain or shine.  You are guaranteed 3 square meals a day except for the 2nd to last week.  Not only that but a roof over your head and free laundry services.  I was injured during my stay so I had to extend my relaxation by an additional 6 weeks, but was afforded comfortable amenities to ensure I healed properly.  Highly recommending everyone should visit this club for a stay.   Down side: a huge sausage fest.<//review>

Back in the summer of '64 everything was a lot better. The staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful. The rooms were very neat clean to a fault and comfortable. The food was quite tasty and there was no limit on how much you could take and casually eat while contemplating the days activity schedule.
The weather was always warm and sunny and we had loads of time to enjoy the outside.
As for the free cloths that the tailors carefully fitted for us they were the finest money could buy.
During the down time you could watch the airplanes take off and land at the nearby civilian airfield.
Everything was very pleasant at least that's how I remember it.<//review>

<Text>Three month all-inclusive vacation. Staff could be a little more friendly. Felt rushed while dining. Beds were pretty comfortable, was woken up in the middle of the night every few days. Skip the sand-pit, too many bugs. Great walking paths with good views. Free barber on site, cut was way too close and fast, did not tip. Pool was cold, life guards seemed attentive but not helpful. Advertising was accurate, no rose garden. Last week was the crucible excursion. 54+ hours duration. Plenty of activities to keep busy, night life was the same. Snacks were provided. Hospitable greetings on the last day, checkout was fast.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80deaba419e6d5b5:0x991353ac0955b5de<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Best government sanctioned summer camp ever, free food, clothes , and utilities, and they even pay you for your stay. But you must book your 3 month stay ahead of time at a local USMC recruitment office. The staff here is kind and very friendly. For those of you that enjoy extreme sports and hitting the gym , MCRD even has something for you. Perfect coastal weather and people from around the world will make this a stay to remember.</Review>

Fantastic views of the airport. Though the beds are not the most comfortable I never had a problem sleeping. On site personal trainers were very motivating and attentive to my workout goals. Stayed three months and though I would never stay here again I would highly recommend.< /review>

<time>1570411668184< /time><rating>5</rating><review>I took some time off a while back and booked a stay at this resort for about 13 weeks. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I figured "what the heck?" To my pleasant surprise, this place was amazing!

The other people staying at this resort were friendly and most of us got along well. I slept in a building with an open floor plan that accommodated quite a few people. The only complaint I have is the bathroom situation can be a little hectic. Also, sometimes tornadoes would blow through and mess up the furniture, so be prepared for that.

The food was so delicious, I don't think it took me longer than a couple of minutes to eat it. I felt like such a pig, but what's the fun of a vacation if you have to watch what you eat? Plus, it's almost a shame to sit inside stuffing your face when you could be outside mingling with your friends and trying to get the full experience of this depot!

From the time I woke up until the time I finally went to sleep, there were tons of activities to do. There was never a dull moment. Also, the staff here are extremely courteous and helpful and will never let you doubt yourself. They will always help you find a way to conquer whatever it is you are doing that day.

If I have to say something bad about this place, which is only fair in a review, I would say the proximity to the airport is a little annoying. Sometimes the jets taking off would keep me awake and it always made me sad knowing people were leaving San Diego without ever knowing this gem of a depot existed.

When it was finally time to leave, which came WAY too quickly, I was sad to see this place go. From all of the staff and people I became good friends with to the beautiful interior and exterior design, I just couldn't stand the thought of waking up somewhere else. Alas, all good things must come to an end.

I HIGHLY recommend this place, but make sure you book 13 weeks so you can experience everything this place has to offer. Anything less than that and you aren't doing yourself justice.< /review>< Pics>

Great time away from the parents and from the state. Fun vacation for 3 months, food is sub par if you have time to enjoy it. The staff have anger and voice problems but you follow what they say or it can turn into a horrible time. This establishment will cloth, bath, feed, give you a slimming down workout, and give a place to sleep. The intern pay is low but over time will get better afterwards. As the staff say, the quickest way to leave this place is to graduate. Dont try and run, it will be a bad time! :) Rah</text>

<Review>Very clean rooms, open environment, best nature walks on the planet, the staff tend to be so friendly that some people mistake their friendliness with neglecting personal space!

Best personal fitness trainers in the country, who give the best advice for staying healthy, and advocate tolerance towards other people though indiscriminate application of Knife Hands.

Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Medical and dental are covered should you need it, and the shooting range is 100% free! Would not get this offer anywhere else!

Was a fantastic paid vacation, 10/10, would do again.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

My kid is there now as I type and he is loving it. I told this old Marine I'm taking care of at the VA and he said, "Loving it? Sounds like a spa to me. They beat the hell out of us when I was there. If he doesn't hate then it's not hard enough."</review>

The staff were outstanding! They're so kind and patient. Whenever you mess up, they'll sit down and have one on one time with you:) one of my favorite part about MCRD was the cough drops and peanut butter packets. I believe you can bring them to the squad bay and share them with the Drill instructors.
Anyways, MCRD was a blast and the rain room was awesome:)

Great place, staff seemed a little rushed and pushy. The annoying stuff were things like: everyone slept in the same room, one central shower/ bathroom, but the beds were comfortable. The resort did have a great view and personal trainers, which again were very pushy, and also FREE haircuts, the barber did go a little short, though. P.S There is a 3 month required stay and one time I tried to sleep in and the staff went crazy.  Overall it was a interesting but nice stay.< /text>

Born in 1960 and reborn 28 July 1977.  My 2nd birth was much more memorable and I love the family I was born to.  All those siblings and encouragement. Food was good (and plenty) double rations as I was 116 lbs  upon arrival.  Checked out of the hotel California at 148lbs and tough as a pine knot.  The beach was beautiful but only olive drab or cammie beachwear. The parks were fantastic but very hilly and we carried our own picnic basket that was worn on our backs.  Tour guides wore nice hats and the attire was very much like the surroundings.  Checked out 3 months later and received a passport that has no expiration.  The name on it is "MARINE".  Highly recommend the "Corps" if your looking to change Everything about you.<//Review>

Spent a few months here, I found that the staff are very rude and extremely bossy, The accommodations are spartan at best. They do have an excellent physical activity program which runs from dawn to dusk. The food is plentiful, but they rush you out way too fast. Also the barber shop is open until 4 am which I found to be very convenient. The worst thing about the place is the constant aircraft noise. The best thing is they take you to another place called Camp Pendleton and let you shoot weapons.<//Text>

Close to the airport with tons of exercise options.  Workers are well trained and very attentive with outstanding attention to detail.  Beds are a bit stiff and the main food hall can get busy and noisy.  Everyone is always in a hurry.  Totally dry:  no beer or booze.  Bathrooms are too small and cramped; showers are cold.  Arrived a slouching Johnny-on-the-block...departed a Mass of Muscle and Confidence.< /review>

<Text>I must say when I checked in it was absolutely the worst service and they were super rude but it was free so I put up with it and little did I know once you check in its hard to check out and the food was good some times bad other times.. The perks were good they had a life Coach and work out coach on staff but in return for their service since I was there for free I had to clean allot and yell allot and play fun games they made up. .. so all in all once you get passed the rude behavior it's a blast< /Text><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

When i first arrived with my tour group we were greeted by our host who was a rather gruff individual.  He seemed nice enough at first but lost his head rather quickly when one of my fellows asked a question i guess was out of hand.  Anyway, we got off the bus and got situated into our rooms, unfortunately the travel packaged didn't mention lack of private space available or that the showers were open showers, but hey, you get what you pay for i suppose.  Though i have to admit, this looks nothing like the pictures...i wonder if i got on the wrong bus...< /review>

Some would quibble over terms and say a more accurate portrayal would be sneaking out at night and scavenging MRE components from dumpsters and hiding them in their footlockers, Private Pyle Style, but they just don't know how to look on the bright side of life. Plus, all the food smuggled in wasn't just from dumpsters.

One recruit had his wife bring in a bunch of candy to the Mormon Sunday service, and several recruits joined him in hiding it under their cammies to sneak it back into the squad bay, where they recruit-taped it to the tops of the pipes above the showers. That was the best candy we ever had, let me tell you.

One lucky recruit even found some week-old Claim Jumpers leftovers that had just been thrown away one night, and got himself a nice Claim Jumpers meal, even if he did litter the head with the containers for the drill instructors to find the next morning. Despite the best efforts of the drill instructors, we never did find out who the lucky winner of the trash-digging contest was, though we all had our suspicions. While I could go on all day about the lovely food, there were plenty of other high points.

Though a few poor sports did break the rules about turning in everything on arrival including the most basic common sense, by and large, most people went along with it. There were plenty of fun events they hosted here such as the Improvise Toilet Paper Challenge, the Drill Instructor Shuffle, and the Bladder Control Failure March. In the end, I think the old motto sums the place up the best. San Diego Recruit Depot: Where Civilians Become Mentally Challenged Recruits.</text>< Name>

Amazing-I drove near the spot that Marine's who are recruits are being trained to be Marines.  I never thought that the Marine Drill Sargeant's got so close to these men and women-but my goodness their hats were touching their hats and nose to nose.  Best wishes and Thanks to all the new recruits going into Marine service-U.S. Navy veteran!< /review>

after what seemed like 'days' of checking in we eventually got situated in our room.  i'll give it high marks for being very clean, but it smelled like duraglit and shoe polish...not sure what that was about.

the beds were small and saggy and the sheets and blanket were really 'scratchy'...but i was able to sleep really well.

the wake up calls were always prompt.

the food was nothing to write home about and the meals all seemed a bit rushed.

i agree with what some other posters said, the soundproofing was absolutely horrible<//review><Rate>3</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<name>Jason Byfield</name><Review>What a terrible place to stay.  First off, you can't book a room without a three month commitment.  The hairstylists only know one style.  The staff steal your clothes and replace them with an outfit that looks like a computer threw up all over it. The food is free but absolutely terrible.  The locals are loud and don't know the meaning of personal space, in fact even the building designers neglected to incorporate any sort of private areas.  You get dust and sand everywhere and hardly any sleep.  There hasn't been any money spent soundproofing the place from the constant air traffic next door.  While I left thirty pounds lighter and overly patriotic, I can't recommend this resort with anything higher than one star.<//Review>< user>

CAUTION: NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART, THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF THE DARK AND THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN IT OR JUST PLAIN WIMPS. In 12 weeks DI's will either make you the guy pumpin your gas or the Marine like he is. Where your parents could NOT reach you will go and find the stuff your made of and test it against yourself. Things your parents couldn't get done in 18 or so years, you will figure out on your own and start doing, or you will be through the gate with a bus ticket.<//review>

Some places may offer discount vacations, others might even offer a free vacation, but to my knowledge this is the only place that will actually pay you to take a 3 month vacation free of charge. Once there, you'll receive a number of other free amenities including free meals, free water (although it's kind of yellow), free haircuts (although they seem rushed and way too close), 1-3 free phone calls and free personal trainers. But wait, there's more. While vacationing at "The Depot" you'll get free lessons in marching, shooting, martial arts and pugil sticks.

The amenities are rather sparse, but it's all part of the experience. While the mattresses are thin and the pillows are barely there, I never had an issue going to sleep in under 5 minutes. They have community showers and insist you use them each day, although sometimes only one shower head is allowed to be used. The restrooms were always spotless, even if they were missing the doors. Still, I found it quite nice some days to use the facilities while having a quaint conversation with one of my new found friends.

I would however avoid the sand pit, or that rather small piece of linoleum known as the quarter deck (which was odd because I never found any quarters there, even with my face pressed against it.) The personal trainers can be a bit up tight, but their routines are often filled with some of the best comedic material I've ever heard, although, I will warn you they're not very good at taking a compliment. Every time I laughed at one of their jokes, it was not received well, although I did usually win a trip to the pit, but it wasn't my cup of tea, although you may like it.

One negative is that there are zero women here. In fact, you most likely will not see a single woman until the end of your 13 week stay. Which I think accounts for some of my fellow travelers marrying very large women after leaving.

Finally, at the end of all, they give you a huge sendoff, beginning with each of you--who are still there--receiving a small token of achievement known as an "EGA". My ceremony was attended by a movie star, R. Lee Ermey, and was a spectacular moment, even if there seemed to have been some onion ninjas who seem to have ambushed a good number of my new friends. Then on the last day, they have a whole parade in your honor and invite your family, many of whom no longer recognize their sons.

While I had mixed emotions about my trip when I left there in 1998, I cannot recommend it highly enough today.</Text>

A place to make memories & build character. I will forever remember the games we played, the challenges we overcame. The knowledge & legacy bestowed upon a young Marine. The tortures nights on firewatch seeing planes come & go or imagining the distant skyscrapers crawling with people. The change is hard, but its forever. Semper Fidelis. Bravo co.1063, 2005.

I just watched their military police leave base property to harass and attempt to intimidate citizens out in the public filming whatever the eye can see.
He also stepped it up a notch by telling them they could not film "from there". So he either knew they were within their rights and desired to deny them of that or he was oblivious. Either way it's NEVER a good idea to leave the base to contact civilians that are just standing in the wide open area, in broad daylight.<//review>

< Review>

This 9 hole disc golf course is an Oasis surrounded by industry and city. Power lines, radio towers and several cell phone towers mark the perimeter of the course, which is a large bowl of grass and some trees.

While the park has trees, Culver City Oil Fields is the dominant view in the distance. And a pocket of West LA and Downtown LA.

Some decently long holes.  Holes 2-4 are heavily pock-marked by ground rodents and has large areas of holey dirt and mowed dead grasses.

There are a few beautiful Huge oak trees, and the course is clean and well maintained. 9 holes are fairly easy to find.

It's not pretty, nor is it challenging, and the course is exposed to wind and the entire park is pretty busy around sunset.

The throwers are rushed, like the people in this city. There are picnics and wanderers inside the course area, to watch for if you have any wild guns throwing in your party.

The high rating is due to lack of other course options in the Los Angeles area, not the creative challenge of this course.

The Good:  It's a real 9 hole course and it's in the West LA area. Good for beginners/intermediate.<//Text>

Big fan of this course. 9 holes going back and forth across the top of the park. All par 3 from about 200 ft to 350 in length. Some good elevation shots. There can be some pedestrians who do not understand disc golf but overall pretty open. Parking costs money but playing is free. Usually not too crowded. Have only had to wait a couple times to tee off. Concrete tee pads, not the best signage to point your way but its hard to get super lost. Would recommend.</review>

This is a hidden gem of a disc golf course within a larger multi purpose park. I had no idea it was here for the longest time.

As someone that grew up playing disc golf, it’s nice to know to know I can play near my residence in Marina Del Rey now.

There’s only really 9 holes, that’s my knock down from a 5 star park. Oak grove and Huntington Beach both double the size. Still a cool spot especially for the Westside.<//Review>

Nice big course.  Great views of the city.  Lots of walking amongst oak trees and expansive lawns. The Saturday we attended there were a lot of people playing the course so it may be the case that your games bump into each other There is a persistent onshore breeze which will have an affect on your game.< /Text>

For a course in an urban area, this was great. The teas are marked clearly with a metal pole and map of each hole along with the distances and par. The course is varied with long and short holes, downhill and uphill, between trees and open fields. It's only nine holes, but for an urban course this is to be expected. There is even a 500 ft par four.<//Review>

Pretty nice disc golf course.  stubborn park goers will get in your way or use the course for other sports.   Always screws up at least one hole per round.< /Review>

The most interesting part for me was the number of gopher holes! Kindof an extra change to walk on tht uneven gopher ground, but a fun SoCal ecosystem to experience.< /text>< rate>

As far as the 9- Basket golf course, I got a nice workout by putting at the closest basket off the Parking lot... It was peaceful at this Park, watching the skylines. I love the Kenneth Hahn Park and this Disc Golf course is a fabulous addition.< /Text>

Our beloved sister passed away unexpectedly. Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks-Griffin Mortuary & Crematory just happened to be the facility our sister's body was taken to due to proximity. We felt so fortunate to have dealt with them, especially Katrina, who was very kind, considerate, friendly, professional, and caring for us who were grieving. While we do not have any comparisons with other mortuaries in LA County, we can strongly state that should you have a need, this is the place you can be assured of for all the caring and tenderness you will need to see you through a terrible time, and will care for your loved one as ours was. Thank you, Karina, and staff, from the bottom of our hearts.<//review>

<Review>My experience with this company has far exceeded my expectations. From the very first encounter on the phone through the entire process I felt that I was personally treated with the utmost consideration, compassion, empathy & respect. All of the details were explained in a very relaxed manner that did not make me feel pressured to choose items that weren't necessary.  My loved one was cared for with the respect, dignity & a sense of caring that put my mind at ease. I would highly recommend this company if this is the kind of care you would like for your dearly departed.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Defenitely worth a visit with some of the all time legendary stars grave or crypt being there. RIP all. It was a lot to take in and rethink the whole life as I walked passed graves of many famous people. Well maintained and staff are nice and friendly. Celebrities from all around the world are resting in there. You can drive or catch public transport there which was not very difficult as we took a bus from Westwood.<//Review>

First of all, I highly recommend preparing your arrangements way before you need to!
When I arrived at Valley Oaks Mortuary for finally preparations for my husband, I felt total
Comfort by the staff.  Bella Marquez walked us through everything with such patients and
Understanding.  Julia Seebode explained to us how the burial would be handle and if we would like anything else added.  The day of the service, the staff at Valley Oaks were amazing.
I will be forever grateful to all of them, during such a difficult time.< /review>

There were other areas that were green, but not all areas. The last visit in December the grass has grown over my mother’s flower vase and grass was crawling close to the writing on all the headstones. That wasn’t an issue this time ( mostly because my uncle cleaned them up for Mother’s Day). It seems this cemetery is getting less cared for every year. I hope that improvements are made.

The ladies and the entire staff at Valley Oaks-Griffin Memorial Park made my grieving less painful as I made the final arrangements for my Beloved Husband.

All my concerns, worries and requested details were addressed with dignity, respect and sincerity which made my husband’s final service beautiful and memorable.

I know when God calls me to my final journey home I will have nothing to worry about except to join my Beloved Husband in Eternal Love & Life.

With deepest respect for Valley Oaks-Griffin Memorial Park,

We've used the services of Pierce Brother's Valley Oaks for 3 members of our family over the last several years. We chose to use them again & again because of their professional & sensitive approach.  They have the ability to provide you with a beautiful memorial for your loved one no matter what your financial situation is at the time. They atr helpful, supportive & the park itself is beautiful & well maintained.  We were very pleased each time we used them.</review>

When my mother took a quick turn for the worse, her caregiver told me I should start making arrangements as I had not yet done so. She said I should starting calling the next day. I decided that Sunday evening to call Pierce Brothers Westlake to find out, if/when my mother passed, would they be able to pick up her body at a moment's notice. Bella gave me a phone number to call should that suddenly happen. That very night, at 1am, my mother passed. Pierce Brothers made it so easy, considering I had made no prior arrangements.
Bella consistently kept me informed what was happening in preparation for my mother's cremation and paperwork that needed to be completed. She was very helpful and made a recommendation on a keepsake item that never occurred to me before - and I'm glad I decided to order one.
Last year, I researched a few mortuaries/crematoriums and even though PB cost was higher, I am a firm believer in you get what you pay for. I am extremely pleased that I made the right choice. It made this difficult time much easier.<//Review>

Peaceful, easy to get to and has multiple entrances. I attended a funeral service this week, staff members are very kind, helpful, and compassionate. What I really appreciated were the complimentary individually wrapped napkin packages and the container holding bottled waters was filled with ice.

The grounds are well maintained and kept with fresh flowers. I drive by the place often, but I never noticed how big the place is.< /Text>

The staff was very helpful during my family's difficult time. They were patient, answered questions, and helped us during the entire process, right up through the end of the funeral. Grounds are kept nicely.</Text>

unfortunately I have several of my family members buried there. Many years ago the original brothers owners always had the grounds looking so beautiful it was always lovely to go there to visit and place flowers and sit for awhile to reflect, the grass was always green and the plots kept up very well. But during the past 2-3 years it has been very disappointing to go there to see the grass always being brown in large patches, and when I go see my family the flower pots are always buried with grass and I have to try to find it and pull the overgrown weeds from the pot. The grass/weeds are also not being trimmed around the plots. Not sure what is happened there but my guess is there are new owners that dont seem to care. I am surprised in this area it has been allowed to happen. Most Cemeteries you have beautiful grounds to know your loved ones are being taken care of, it used to be here, but no longer. Very sad, please get with your landscapers Pierce Brothers and make it a beautiful place again.< /review>

They took care of my Mother (March, 2010) and the service was great, now they are taking care of my Father (May, 2014). I am giving them only 3 stars and not 5 for the following reason:
4 years ago we needed to show a video done in HD, but they had only DVD format and I complained about it, they said they will pass it on to "CORPORATE", well 4 years later still the same old technology.
In an age where technology and mass connectivity is easier than ever I am baffled that why they cannot give their client a simple HDMI connection. I was told we cannot connect to their system. I could have played an MP4 in full HD format from my cell phone through an HDMI connection. I hope they get the message so that others saying goodbye to their loved ones can do it in a clear way not low resolution old century style.</Text>

<review>RepairAll delivered great service, I am very satisfied with the job. I brought in 2 apple laptop that needed batteries change. They diagnosed it correctly, ordered the parts and soon as the parts got in they installed it without any delays. Their price is reasonable. I highly recommend them for apple computer repair. Also they are very knowledgeable in diagnosing iphone problem.<//review>< pictures>

I just got the screen on my S8 Plus replaced from this place. Troy is a very knowledgeable guy and he knows what he's doing. He gave me the lowest price out of all the other places in the mall. He used the original parts from Samsung that comes with a lifetime warranty. It took about an hour to fix the screen which is not bad at all for some quality work. The customer service is great and I am very pleased with my experience overall. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to fix their phone.</Text>

<text>I just recently wrote a review on Yelp!   Make sure you read that one. My experience at this particular RepairAll was especially good because I had the pleasure of working with Clara.  She’s the manager, and for good reason. She took care of my problem and was very helpful In explaining the reasons for the problem.  Hopefully, I don’t drop or break any of my devices, but if I do, it’s back to  Repair All and Clara.<//text>< pictures>

The sales associate named Troy Harris was very informative and helpful. He assured me that the screen protector I was purchasing was the best option for my phone. After applying it on, he made sure I was satisfied with the fit and if I was not, that he would open another screen protector box. The customer service was beyond outstanding! He was able to save me another $10 off my puchase by signing up for their free VIP list/mailing list. Very happy with my purchase as I was able to purchase it at a fair price. I had gone to other places in the mall and they were less than accommodating. Thanks, One Stop Phone Repair!< /text>

I took my sister and my sons iPhone to get checked out. Both phones were thoroughly checked for issues and Ramsey updated me every step of the way. He is knowledgeable, quick and has great customer service! I will refer all my friends and family to One Stop for all of their repair needs!<//text>

<Review>These guys are awesome. After going to around Stockton wanting to get my phone screen fixed and being denied these guys went above and beyond to exceeding my expectation. A bit pricey, but they have a lifetime warranty on the screen. They not only fixed my screen but also replaced my front facing camera.  Ajay, thanks for being patient and taking the proper procedure to making your customers happy. Shoutout to Rob for marketing this location and making me feel confident about trusting you guys.< /Review><rate>5< /rate></record>

I spoke with the store proprietor, Baha who provided me with an excellent analysis of  the problem and condition of my phone. After providing me with the analysis he recommended several options in reference to repair. The price of the repair was reasonable, and well within my budget. I would recommend his services to anyone who is in need of phone repair.< /text></record>

The lady and gentleman that helped me fix my phone were amazing!! I went to 2 other places before visiting them, both of the other places tried charging me hundreds of dollars. The employees at repairAll took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and tried a few things on my phone and they were able to fix my phone for WAY less. They were funny and nice and really made my day. Thank you soooo much!!!!</text>

<username>amber gill</username><Text>These guys and gal were great. They go above and beyond basic customer service and really care about helping people.  I actually called them on accident thinking it was the shop I left two of my phones at.  That shop wouldn’t respond and help my phones for days. This place actually went out of there way to relay my messages fir me and helped, even though I wasn’t their customer.  I’m from out of town and had to come in person to check on the status of my phones.  The other shop hadn’t done anything and told me one couldn’t be repaired.  I took my phones to these guys and partly just to thank them.  They fixed the phones right away and have the friendliest employees.  You get what you pay for, honesty, better quality work and warrantee.  The massage chairs, water, and tv alone make the wait pleasant and the shop is very nice.</Text>< Response>

<text>Place seemed professional except at first they told me that my phone would take an hour to fix but i would have to wait 1 week for the part to get there and I'm like ok that's fine and then at the end of the week I called they said it would take a few more days and I'm like ok it's fine and then I called 1 more time and they told me it would take about another week for the part to get there. Normally I wouldn't mind waiting but I needed my phone since I was about 2 almost 3 weeks without a phone so I just went to the shop and picked up my phone again and they charged me a $45 down payment and they didn't even work on it and also the guy there told me that his manager was going to keep me informed about the part but she never did. Based on my experience I wouldn't recommend anyone here< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

My iPhone 6 overheated and it bricked on me. No sign of life on that phone. I went in seeing if maybe the battery could be replaced and it'd be fine. He took the time to take the phone apart and diagnose the phone for me. After trying multiple things (also explained everything he was doing and checking for in the process) he found out that when I dropped my phone it had damaged the inside of the phone. He showed exactly where the heat was forming at and gave me his advice for what would be my best option. This was definitely A-class service.  Highly recommend this place for anyone needing phone repairs.< /Text>

I called got a quote for my Samsung Note 8 cracked screen. I came right down. I didnt have to wait. Joe was very friendly and great customer service. Explained everything that he could do to fix it perfect. But also gave me what could go wrong too. He told me about a hour and a half. I walked around the mall. Checked in with him once. All was going great. And he would be done early with my phone. He finished in less than a hour an a half. The phone was perfect and he walked me through all he did. And showed me how to sign up for all the diffrent warranties on my screen saver. Highly recommend Them to anyone. Thank you Joe. You saved my day!!!

Great first time experience, prices weren't completely unreasonable employees were very helpful and friendly. Dude even introduced me into their new rewards program which is completely worth it due to an immediate 10$ off coupon. Will do business here in the future.</Review>

I got my iphone 7 fixed here and just had to write a review. It was the fastest service i have ever recieved and I am pleased to say that my phone has been working wonderfully ever since the repair. I have a lifetime warranty with them under my belt in case I have any problems, and they even gave me a great deal on a glass screen protector as well! I will be referring all of my friends and family around the area.
Thank you guys!<//Review>

The gentleman thy helped us was curtious and very helpful. He explained everything that fixing our phone would entail and the pricing. He quoted a price and time it would take to fix it. He went above and beyond expectations. Have been here for three phones and an iPad . Love this business and would recommend to everyone.<//text>

I came in to get my battery and charging port changed. Ramsey and Ajay gave me a good deal and threw in a device tune up which made my phone run alot faster. They gave a great deal and I was in and out in 30 mins. I still need to come and get my other iPhone 6 repair and I will definitely come back here. I would recommend this place to everyone.

Great customer service!!!!< /Review>

Service was phenomenal. After an horrible weekend and experience at APPLE . I was referred too One Stop. Mike helped me not only did he beat Apples pricing but he repaired promptly and even discounted an otter box to prevent future breaks. I would refer all my friends and family to One Stop . Ask for Mike.<//review>

<Review>I have an HTC M One 8 phone that had a cracked screen and a old battery. Very hard to find a refurbished CDMA android phone at a decent price. Managed to find a new one at a good price but the motherboard had defective software. Talked to many repair shops and none would take on a battery or screen replacement for the HTC. Talked to Clara and she scheduled an appointment with a seasoned veteran technician Berto. I asked him to transplant the entire Motherboard to the new phone. This is not a normal request. He took on the project and succeeded. The price was more than fair and the staff are really nice, honest, and genuine. I don't want to forget to mention the massage chair that was available while I waiting. This is by far the best phone repair shop I have ever been too.<//Review><gmapID>0x80901808cc3d38ef:0x735e211438c72e3e<//gmapID>< user_id>

<Text>This place is HORRIBLE! We took our phone here to get our cracked screen replaced, they replaced it and when we got it back it wouldn't turn on. It had to be plugged in to turn on. The volume button was stuck on up. So you couldnt use the phone. So the next day I took it back ( we didn't even have the phone back for 12 hours) the guy said he would take it apart to see what wrong with it. Days go bye and no one is returning my calls so I go back in. He said they are buying a new phone cause they can't figure out what is wrong with it. Ok great. Another week goes bye. Again no one returns my calls so I go in. The guy doest know what going on with this phone. Again I only took it in for a cracked screen. So I get a call from customer service they can't get me a new phone. So I'm out of 160 dollars with of phone and they took my phone and gave me a galaxy s2 phone that wasn't even set back to factory settings. I took it to AT&T and they said that I was ripped off (which I already knew) and that the battery had been overheated so many times that it could burst any minute that it is expanding. So they took my phone for with 160 dollars and gave me a used 40 dollar phone. That I can buy at target. Looks like a prepaid cheep phone. Don't go here!<//Text>< Resp>

We had talked to Jeff about how much would it cost to fix an iPad mini 2 gen. He gave details and said if they had the screen they could do it in couple hours.
Two weeks after we go visit our mom that lives in Tracy, ( I’m from north bay, Petaluma ca) so we take the iPad and call around 2pm on a Saturday, I tell Troy that we needed to fix the screen and told me it might of take long and the iPad could be ready the next day Sunday. So we rush to the actual store. Been there we tell Joe and Troy our situation that we are out of town and we needed to leave that same day. They accommodate our situation and Joe said he can fix it in couple of hours. We went shopping and before you knew it couple hours later the old was ready. If anything goes wrong with the screen we can take it back and they will fix it free. I trusted this guys right off the bat and by helping us out, even tho they where super busy made me realize that not only they do there jobs but also care for every customer. Joe was real awesome and helpful. Troy was as well very helpful in the situation. We applied for vip and got 10 dollars off. Plus bought a 25$ case and they left it for 15$. Great experience. I kind of love this store. Good job repair all (one stop phone repair)!!</text>

I took my ipad air 2 for repair
It was not turning on, they said it was a bad battery
So they ordered the battery and when it arrived I cameback and left my ipad
Hrs later they called n said the screen was turning on but the touch was not working
The next day I went to pick it up and they said they put the new battery on and it was still not turning on
Then they put the old battery. Back on and it turned on but the touch wasnt working and I needed a new screen $280 n they said the battery was good
I didnt wanted to get it fix so I took the ipad home I put it on the charger and found out battery was no good was just charging up to 70%
Couple days later I opened the ipad to try n replace the battery my self and found out te ipad was missing some parts I went to one stop and told them about it they said they will call me back
They didn't,  I went back again a week later and I told them I just wanted my missing parts
They said same thing,  we ll call you later,
they never called or give me back my missing parts</text>

We’ve taken in two different phones for repair. They “warranty” their work. However, neither phone was ever actually repaired after multiple attempts. What a waste of money.<//Review>

Worst place ever , worst experience , dropped my iPod for cracked screen (was to be fixed in 30 minutes) inexperienced people working there of course couldn't fix it , after tons of calls one day after a week got iPod back but now camera and home button won't work ( that was working before repair) , here goes another week then got call they can't fix it but they will provide me new iPod but can't refund $110.00 dollars , so here goes another ten days , then finally got message to pick up new iPod , when went to pick up , Ali handed me an old iPod with already scratches on screen , but arguing that he never said he will provide brand new iPod , then I said you said new iPod ( if not brand new) he just kept giving non sense reasons , very disrespectful,unprofessional , offered if not will give my broken iPod and refund but no new iPod , and wasted my whole month , got call from corporate office that they will take action on it ( hope so) , Ali won't give manager's number , will not recommend to anyone to go there ( it's the shop close to Payless shoe store/ target in Tracy ) Will post another post if I ever hear from corporate office for any action taken . Save your time , your phone and your money for not going there.< /text>

I love this place! They’re tacos are my favorite, the service there is great, staff is super friendly, leave a tip cause they deserve it. They can get busy and the wait time could suffer but that’s only a testament to how delicious the food is.< /Text>

<review>My wife and I come to Bakersfield 6 times a year and always look for the best Mexican restaurants which always seem to be the most expensive. Due to the Covid virus we decided to just do Take-out at Los Tacos and boy were we surprised. We feel they have the best Mexican food around.. Not only is it so delicious but they give you huge portions at great pices. Even after the virus ends and restaurants reopen we are sticking with Los Tacos.< /review><gmapID>0x80ea42826f242557:0x1fe257787296b464</gmapID><user_id>109198889324349682738<//user_id>< Name>

I’ve just moved to Bakersfield from Los Angeles two years ago. And I have been to several so called Mexican restaurants and have been deeply disappointed. But with Los Tacos, I found sanctuary. Great hard shell tacos, enchiladas, taquitos and chicken bowl that’s top notch. Great service< /text>

Love this place for years now. Best guacamole and chips, salsa is good, seafood burrito is my favorite. Not bad for mexican fast food. They have huge size combination plates for cheap. Me and my husband ate dinner for $20 and had leftovers.<//text>

I don't know why all of these comments are so bad.  I work around the corner, and come here daily for a couple of Carne Asada tacos for lunch.  I try a lot of hole in the wall places for tacos all through town, and they have at least one of the best asada tacos I can find.  Their horchata is good too, but granted, there isn't always some available.
They also have a really good deal! 2 for 2 (2 tacos and 2 burritos) for $4.99.  Their Mexican pizza is also to die for!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!< /review>

Says it's open at 9 am online. I showed up a little after and it was closed. Came back a few days later at 10 am ordered an asada torta from drive thru, they gave me a burrito. I drove  back to exchange it and they still had me pay the $1 difference on top of that they didn't have horchata.<//Review>

<Text>A couple of weeks ago, I did out about the DAILY happy hour at Pita Jungle. The place had a good vibe. Wes, the bartender, is friendly.  The happy hour food specials are good and the prices are great! Beer and wine is $2 off and there are Happy Hour cocktail specials, too. The patrons are friendly, no Newport Beach attitude. This is my new Happy Hour hang.< /Text>< name>

They offer gluten free options and have an allergens break down on their website as well as in the restaurant. The waitress knew her ingredients too. I did not need the list because she helped find an entree for me. The food was delicious and the portions were perfect. I could not finish my food and had to take it home. It was just as tasty the second day. Thank so much for the incredible service, you went above and beyond for my family!! We will be back.< /Review>< Pictures>

Love their hummus trio.  The Greek pita bread is deliciously fluffy.  The only draw back is the service can sometimes be really terrible.  Out of the last 5 times I've been here, 3 times were really bad service, 1 time so so, and 1 time good.  With better management, this place can be awesome!< /Text>

<Text>The food gets 5 stars, but the service got a 1! I love the food here and I never give bad reciews, but they made my wife and I feel pretty worthless this time. The waitress had no personality, never smiled once. Once we got our food we were never offered a refill (and I drink a lot of soda!). It wasn't busy so about 4-5 waitresses had time to take a break and chit chat. I guess that's why it took them about 15 to 20 minutes to offer to bring us our check after we finished eating. I will definitely go back, but this time I guess I have to dress classy and act like am high class to get service. After all, it is "Newport"...<//Text>< Resp>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Super rude service. We walked in and, whom I believe would be the manager, did not help us or greet us! He sat there conversing with his friends. I believe this had something to do with race, because when we asked him to see the menu he pointed at it and continued to ignore us and talking to others already seated at the bar. There aren’t many vegetarian or vegan options. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone. Very disappointed.<//Text>< Pictures>

Dry shawarma wrap. The garlic dip needs help. Maybe being Mediterranean makes me picky but I was very disappointed at these prices. What a bummer that the service was lacking too. They should have middle eastern music going as well as middle eastern art perhaps instead of local student's work.</Review>

The mark of a good restaurant is not necessarily its size, but the quality of its food and the generosity of its staff. Along that line, some of the finest dining experiences I've had throughout my career have been in the small diners and dives scattered throughout Orange County. Regrettably, Pita Jungle is not among these gems.

The location of the diner makes it appear promising. The owners were at least wise in this regard, having selected a spot with a splendid view and great location in Newport Beach. Furthermore, because the building stands on its own instead of being wedged between other storefronts, patrons are granted full view of the scenery regardless of whether they choose to sit outdoor or one of the two dozen tables set up indoors.

This is fortunate, considering the fact that as my friend and I approached Pita Jungle's Diner, fully intending to take a seat outside, We noticed layers of bird droppings and cigarette ash caked onto the tables and chairs. I suppose I should have taken that as an omen.

The seats inside the restaurant were not much better than those outdoors, but dustings of crumbs and smears of tomato sauce stains are at least a little less appalling than animal excrement. We seated ourselves at the cleanest table we could find. Looking around, we only noticed two other customers. Since it was Dinner time on a Sunday evening, this should have been our second warning signal, but we still continued on in our culinary adventure.

Fifteen minutes after we sat down, a teenage girl with long, greasy hair finally arrived to take our order. It took over 45 minutes for our order to arrive. We ordered Two salads. The salads were old and had no taste whatsoever. The server had a very bad attitude and was very rude. She kept asking us where did we come from. She claimed we had an accent. She was white and she claimed that her dad owned the place.

There was few customers that arrived after us and they were served immediately. We waited over 45 minutes for our two salads to arrive and when we confronted another server about the wait and asked her how long does is usually take to serve two salads, her response was 15 minutes max. She then went inside and whispered something to out server and our food was then brought out.

Pita Jungle mailed out coupons in order to promote their business. Once you present the coupon, there whole attitude changes.They are rude and untrained. They over charged us and tried to apologize about it. Most of their servers are drug addicts and alcoholics. They are very unprofessional and dishonest.

Pita Jungle claims to be a Middle Eastern Dinner yet they discriminate against people that are not white. They use the coupons to attract customers and once you try to present the coupon, they treat you differently and finally over charge you on your bill.

Visiting Pita Jungle was certainly an experience to remember, but one that I never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone else. If you are tempted by the luscious landscape and the storefront, you would be better off bringing a camera to the restaurant than your appetite.

Again, Pita Jungle is not a place to dine. They are very dirty, dishonest, unprofessional use fake advertising in order to bring customers in. They try to make excuses not to honor their coupons. They are not Middle Eastern and all there employees are not trained. They don't know how to treat customers and just if you do go there, check out the tattoos all over the server's bodies. My friend knows two of the servers their through other family members and I had to find out after the incident that both servers were in jail before for drugs.

I don't feel safe eating there. They try to over charge you by adding an additional drink to your bill thinking that you would not pay attention.

My friends and I are in the process of filing a civil law suit against them. We are also reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and to the arabic community all over Orange County.

Pita Jungle should not be in business.< /Text>

The food was very close to the authentic taste I grew up with; it was fresh and delicious. My wife loved the Falafel, I and the boys enjoyed the  Chicken Shawarma Sandwiches. The hummus was good, but not quite authentic tasting, the Tabouleh  was fresh and tasted very good, but can use some more lemon. I highly recommend this place, and will definitely go back.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>This was probably our third visit and so far we've liked most everything we've had.  Tonight it was Baba Ganoosh and Garlic Lemon Chicken w/ Pine Nuts, along w/ House Red Wine for the DH and Shipyard Monkeyfist IPA for myself for HH.  Then we used a Groupon for the Yellowfin Tuna Honey Sesame Salad and Roasted Garlic & Portobello Pizza.  Our server failed to put in the salad order along with the pizza, but came back and owned up to her mistake, then got her manager to comp us a dessert.  We weren't in any hurry so it would've been fine anyway, but the extra effort was appreciated.  Being 10 miles away, it takes a Groupon to entice us to go out of our 'hood, but we'd definitely be there more often if it were right down the road.< /text><Name>busyinoc< /Name><rate>4<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Love all the ducks, the huge size of the park and great staff. And its right next to police station so it feels "Extra" safe. Needs more tables and benches or Id give it 5 stars<//Text>

<review>I brought my daughter here to see the ducks and she really liked it. It's a nice park!  But I felt so bad to see mama duck with all her duckies swimming in the dirty pond. There was so much trash I hope they clean it soon.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtcUJZz0UdVEoowF3-LZTCgWlTq6tpR2pfUNB1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

Not that I have a pet but their pet park is pretty nice. Tennis court is way too far. The court is next to the playground and the restroom, now that's a plus. The pond is nice but too much bird poop.< /text>

My family and I enjoyed this park so much.. Surrounded by nature breathing in fresh air as I sit and gaze into pure the pond were the ducks and the ducklings follow behind. Cute .. Waddle..Waddle
*Acrobatic's for the kids..
*Lots of space to run around.. Have a picnic..
*Tables for a birthday party perhaps.. The park has trails for a nice jog.. It *Tennis courts..
*Basketball Courts..
*Parking/Handicap Friendly< /Review>

<username>Marisol Campos</username><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>We went in a field trip with our students and for the most part, this is a place with an abundance of wild life. We were able to see many turtles, wild ducks, birds, etc.

Yes, for kids, this is a fantastic park to visit, it's free!!! We walked all the way across and had lunch there.

Local places sometimes are forgotten, and instead of driving far and spend more money, I always encourage people to enjoy of what we have in our community.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The trash cans are corroded at the bottom, making trash fall out of the bottom if can is moved. There is a lot... and I mean A LOT of poop everywhere. You constantly have to look down to walk. Hope they clean this park up. Otherwise, Nice shade trees, tennis courts and ample parking.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Kinda dirty and cruddy. The city needs to do much better with this park. Being next door to a sheriff station, you'd think they'd want it to look nicer. There's poop EVERYWHERE!! Duck and dog. A high pressure wash down of the walkways every once in a while would be nice. There's also a few homeless people living there, but I've never had any problems with anyone there. This park has great potential, but we don't go too often.</Text>

Nice, big open area, plenty of trees, nice lake. Its cool with tennis courts, a playground and basketball court. Its pretty decent. Mostly green, wish it was greener (more grass than dirt).

Its always a pleasure to come here and escape the city to semi feel like you're in the country.. I recommend taking your children to see the ducks in the pond or walking your dog its a big open field here also parks and recreation pool tables basketball court.... my only complaint is the public restrooms could use some help ... that's a job city of long beach could take car of ... easy to access ftom the street police secured and close by one block away from the YMCA and Bixby shopping center...<//Review>

I love going to my park in my neighborhood. I love watching the birds .  I have seen some real beautiful ones that I would  have never seen if I wasn't sitting still and ta king in the scenery. The most special birds to me were a cobalt blue looking bird that in the sun seemed to really look neon blue. Fabulous looking.< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>It's really nice here. There are a lot of ducks which makes it entertaining for kids and adults alike. There's also a toddler playground and a bigger kid playground, a shaded giant sand box, and a separate swing area. If you have a dog they have a dog park area that seperates the small dogs from the larger ones. If you're into exercise, there are trails all over including a steep area near Atlantic to really work out your legs. It's a gorgeous park, there are a lot of little bridges and photo areas too!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

One of the best places to hang out in long beach. It has a nice little pond full of ducks. A nice place to sit to enjoy the view. And the air feels so fresh here.</review>

<Review>Very peaceful big park. I come here to play tennis with my tennis buddies. They have four tennis courts. Very well maintained. We usually get a court especially on weekdays. Lots of parking.

The city really let this park go. It was nice and healthy before the North Long Beach Police Department decided to set up there. Seems like NO money goes into this park anymore and it goes all to them. Heartbreaking because this was one of my all time favorite parks as a child. Sad sad saddd</review>

<review>This park could be phenomenal instead the upkeep is horrible. The bathrooms are disgusting. The play area for the kids is full of trash debris and junk. The paved walkway throughout the park is full of duck do do. The duck pond is filthy . I feel so sorry for those animals. The young people that work in the office are always sitting around laughing and talking instead of getting a broom and come out and sweep the and wash down the surrounding area. Do not let any of your kids go in the bathrooms alone. There's lot of suspicious looking creepy men ,homeless and the deprived hanging around that park. Some sleeping on the ground mumbling to themselves.  One old white man was in and out of his car  as if he's doing something very important. Back and forth and back and forth he went rearranging stuff in his car; up and down  very strange. He had no shirt on and half his behind was reveled due to his pants almost falling down right in front of play area for children. Young thugs or maybe people living in their cars, smoking drugs, sleeping and making out behind their tinted windows. Just horrible. Even though the police department it's right next door you very rarely see them circulating the park in fact their building seems deserted. All these other people who gave this place five stars is odd to me. They must have came when the Park first opened and it was beautiful because it sure need officials to intervene and change this scenario I just described.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<name>Alan Ray (Alan Ray)<//name><text>I like this Dog Park because it's small and has trees for shade inside of the Dog "Pit" areas.
They could use more pooper scoopers and some general maintenance, but all in all it is a good park.
This Dog Park is pretty laid back for the most part. I like the area around the park also, plenty of trees and grassy areas with picnic tables. The restrooms are too far away in my opinion, can't change that, but they could add a couple of portable toilets just outside of the Dog Pit areas for customer convenience.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The playground needs major updating the spiral slide is cracked and you can see a previous patch in it the swings looks soiled the sand is very dirty I even saw a glass pipe in it so be careful with your children and not enough shade on the small playground or in the larger playground the restrooms needs to be cleaned more often and many times I seen drug sales going on to young children people in park cars smoking marijuana or some other type of drugs NC homeless tents in park areas</text>

Huge park with a dog park as well. Also has a huge man made lake with lots of ducks. Fairly safe park as there is a police station on the park grounds.</Review>

This is favorite dog park in Long Beach. It's got two separate pens, one for small dogs and one for large dogs. The park is massive, and or even has a small duck pond, along with basketball courts and a playground for the kids.</review>

<Text>This is sadly a very dirty park!!!
I went yesterday to take my goddaughter 6/15/15 and the pond was soooooo DIRTY!
It was sad that there were no fishes, no turtles in the and barely any ducks!
The grass area was clean, the parking lots and the tennis courts but the water was just disgusting..
I did see a Park Ranger there walking around but I don't understand how the water is kept so dirty!
I really do hope someone does something about this!</Text><date>1434482965848< /date><username>Karla Lease< /username>< Rating>
