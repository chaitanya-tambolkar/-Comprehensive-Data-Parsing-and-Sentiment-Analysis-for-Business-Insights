Just got my exhaust installed today. The guy that did it was very pleasant and down to earth. I like that he check his work making sure everything was right and correct as he was working on my car instead of just trying to getting it down. He made me feel like the work he did was important to him that it was dobe to the best of his ability. There was a point where i said that my exhaust looks good enough for me and he said not for me its not., like he wanted it to be better. And he did. Definity will go back to him for all my exhaust needs.<//text>

Awesome shop. Work is done fast and with care. Really appreciate the effort the owner puts into making sure you as a costumer feel happy with the outcome. If you need anything done to your exhaust from a cat replacement to an exhaust leak, this shop gotcha covered.</text>

I left a voicemail on Saturday night to confirm that they were indeed open on Sunday -- they are! I received a return call when they opened. It was Sunday morning, but I didn't need an appointment that day. When I came we discussed a few points on a custom exhaust: my thoughts versus his experience; his thoughts were valuable. He did the job quickly, the install is clean and the tip is placed perfectly; the whole setup was thoughtful and well designed. The price was fair in my experience. Therefore, I had a genuine 5-star experience.<//text>

<Text>Just left AMC services. Angel was very professional had to get a new catalytic converter. He installed less than 30 minute. When Angel was done he checked for exhaust leaks from previous muffler work from another muffler shop. I will recommend to all my friends and anybody who needs muffler work. Thank you Angel for the great work fair pricing  and being so professional.</Text></record>

Took it to another and they didnt make it any better. Found AMC and Angel cut me a break on fixing the welds. He cleaned them all up and made sure there were no exhaust leaks whatsoever then showed me just to make sure i was satisfied. He even helped me install my new exhaust manifold gasket which had a broken bolt. Started up the truck and it was nice and quiet like it should be. Will be coming back anytime i need exhaust work.

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>As appetizer we got chips and a sauce of beans which was very tasty. I ordered an Enchilada & Burrito. The Burrito was very good, the Enchilada so so. My friend ordered Enchilada, tamales & tacos of shrimp. The tamales weren't good and the tacos just OK.
The attention was very good.
I would give 3.5 stars, but since there isn't, and attention was good, I put 4.< /Text>< Pics>

Good Mexican cuisine. There are a lot of really good Mexican food places around here so it's tough to be competitive.  La Hacienda has been around for a long time so they must be doing something right.  The fried Tilapia plate is fantastic.< /text>

I took more than one bite to confirm, and had my bf confirm who spat it out ‚Äî the meat wasn‚Äôt okay (and it smelled like it had gone bad, too). I get al pastor at a lot of places ‚Äî there was no mistaking that this one was funky.

The other items (fish taco, shrimp taco, steak fajitas, churros) were perfectly decent! Hence three stars.

But no place should be serving you meat that has gone off. Need some quality control before cooking and serving.<//text><date>1594501719907</date>< rating>

At the first moment  you enter that place  the waiters give you a pleasant feeling. Very friendly waiters, it is a good place to go out with your friends or with your date. enjoyable  cuisine, specialist  chief cook and stuff, modest  price and attentive  service. Warmly recommended.<//text>

The food was good, but our orders were all wrong.  We ordered 5 burritos to go, when we got home only two of them were what we ordered.  We'll five it another try.</Review>

While on our way to the Golden Gate Bridge we decided to stop by after looking at the area I was a little weary however breakfast was amazing for all of us!! Although it does look like a place most people just use as a takeout option but they have plenty of seating and are kid-friendly< /Review>

They wont follow instructions. I asked for nacho fries with everything on the side and they still put beans on it rhe waiter even forgot our order. Took like 20 minutes to get our drinks and rhe drinks were the onlt good part. To make a long story short, i will never come here again and you should NOT come here</Text>

Surprised by the high ratings with the disappointing food experience today. The tortilla chips were stale. The chili relleno was fried in old oil and had a bad aftertaste. The chicken in the enchilada was not fresh. And everything is on the pricey side too.

Definitely not worth it.</text>

<text>The first time I Had steak tacos, the meat tasted horrible...
I wanted to give them a second change, came back and got chicken mole enchiladas, the meat tasted bad and meat looked horrible,  and the sauce didn‚Äôt taste like mole.
I share my unpleasant expirence with the owner , but she didn‚Äôt seam to care not even offered to take some money off my tab to compensated me for the horrible experience.< /text>< gmap_id>

I tried this place couple months ago and was not happy with the food.. ..Today I decided to try it again and well..... Nothing has changed,  food was really bad.  I ordered 2/sopes but was forced to order 3 because they can't only make 2 (makes no sense )
Well they never told me that it comes with beans and rice. Sopes were really bad, bad taste, salsa was not good and did not have flavor.  The only thing that was really good was the beans and rise.  I feel I paid way to much for those sopes that I ended up throwing away.  I would not recommend this place to no one. More</Text>

< Review>
Consistently good Mexican fare, awesome burritos and guacamole. I always get the chilli relleno burrito, with chips and guac as well. Very nice people, who make great food for the most part. Chips are a bit lacking in the salt and taste department. The included salsas are also a bit bland, but it's not a big deal.< /Review>

If you need the food modified, say no chile for a child, no cilantro for an allergic, they are very accommodating. Few selections of chile, other curtido or beers, but adequate.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Great Mexican food. The beans are homemade, you get a basket of chips with beans and salsa while you wait for your food. I had the Taquitos, they were served with lettuce, sour cream and pico. My children had the chicken wings with fries, and my husband had camarones a la diabla. The food was delicious, the only downside is the location.<//Text><Name>Rose Hernandez</Name></record></dataset><record>

My last Chinese doctor closed her door and my eczema was getting worse without her herbs and creams. Thankfully I thought to try searching for another Chinese doctor who offered virtual appointments. The free email consultations were helpful and her herbal capsules very effective. I nearly 98% healed my skin in just 1 month, but stress and anxiety made me want to eat poorly and more sugar so I set myself back. But I am working on getting back on track and am thankful for this clinic! If you have eczema, definitely try this place out!</text>< rate>

The Skin BRIGHTENING Cream is softer and cleaner, I feel my face more light and shine. I LIKE THE CHINE MEDICE BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS. I WISH that treatment going to be effect for me and others people. Thanks Dtr. LI< /Review>< Pictures>

I have used the products for over 5 years and love them they do exactly what they say.  The results vary person to person and cycles of each person‚Äôs auto immune flares can delay the results.  I have had great results<//review>

I found Merry Clinic in 2014 when I was diagnosed with Dyshidrotic Eczema with no help from the Dermatologist except compound cremes.  Within 2 weeks of Skin detox and EcDermaid.  Itching gone dark patches cracked skin from scratching gone. I swear by this product and always make sure my cabinet at all times.  And I always recommend.
Thank you De Merry Li.</Text>

<text>I had psoriasis since 6 years. I tried everything when I say everything means everything. Pills. Pins. Cream everything. I just started with merry clinic pure pills and the other pills for clear skin also the soap. and I started to see improvement. I know it is too early but I have to say I start see improvement. My advice use Vaseline twice a day along with the medicines to keep your skin wet and soft. I will update my review next few months.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1568337313366, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Ahmad.

Impressed with quick response to free online consult, along with Dr. Merry‚Äôs  recommendations. Very fast shipment of products. Scalp oil seems to have calmed the itchiness of psoriasis within less than a week of starting. Too soon to tell if Psoriaid and skin detox blends will clear it.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I have so much faith in this product.  Vitilax capsules are amazing! I started this for my son, around 3 years ago.  To get him to take his supplements was an extreme challenge as a growing teenager.  Now, a college student, studying bio chemistry, and applied physics, he requests that I send supplements to him.  He knows how amazing these supplements are and my son sees the difference in his skin.  As a mom, I can't stress it enough, how grateful I am to Merry Clinic.  I live in an area where many physicians don't practice like Dr. Li....so I have always researched areas of the world to get what I need for better health.  Humbled and grateful. ;o)</text>< Pictures>

I contacted Merry Clinic in 2012, shortly after my dermatologist (finally) accurately diagnosed an outbreak on my hands and feet. The prognosis turned out to be Palmar/Plantar Psoriasis. After a useless visit to San Francisco's Psoriasis Clinic, I found MC. Dr. Li's herbal treatment changed my life. After a brief consultation over the phone, I received the supplements in two days and said "Bye, Felicia!" to Prednisone and the topical ointments. I can walk. People are no longer afraid to shake my hand. To boot, every single person I've sent to MC raves over their results. 85-90% success rate?! For real!< /text>

Is too early I think to know if it is working on my eczema, but I can tell you one thing: I started taking this pills and using the cream 3 days ago, and for very first time my heals are not cracked  in pain. So, I am going to continue taking  the pills until gone, and I definitely reorder them if they work.< /review>

<Review>I've been buying Luperaid for my mom for years now, it has helped her tremendously, especially in the times of flares...she doesn't constantly take them due to not wanting her body to become accustomed to them which ewe found works best for her. Thank you again.

I started the treatment plan last Wednesday (5 days ago) and my plaques are almost gone. My 15 year old son couldn‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôm so thrilled with my results thus far. Thank you!!<//review>

I have been ordering Vitilax and Vitilax oil from Merry Clinic for more than ten years now or maybe twenty for my vitiligo and so far so good. It always arrived on time and it did a great deal in controlling my skin disease. I did not encounter any problem with them from the time I started and they always send coupons for good old customers. Truly remarkable.</text>

I have never experienced this before and I had spent weeks looking for answers, trying various topical things, and taking a few supplements but nothing was working very quickly. I know enough about herbs and natural healing to understand that many skin issues like this are gut related. I ordered the skin detox and EcDermaid supplements and have been taking them for about 7 days. It's already made a huge difference, my skin is healing! It's finally going away. I also appreciate that my order came with instructions, foods to avoid etc. I have used these supplements along with a topical aloe gel containing structured silver and sea buckthorn oil directly on the areas of concern. I am beyond thankful for traditional chinese medicine and the Merry Clinic for offering these products.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I think the first reviewer lied about the effectiveness of the herbs from this clinic. I have psoriasis too and the herb from this place never worked for me. I spent over $500 on for several trials and it's still not working. Not happy with this practice at all. Avoid!<//text>

<Review>They have great wine selection and their food is absolutely delicious. Everything is fresh and perfect. 9/10 times you get a great waiter too, but 4 you get one who is not really concerned with the guest experience. I think it may have been because I was there with my partner and two kids. He seemed somewhat anti-kid. My kiddos are total foodies and were looking forward to a 1st class experience and it was a bit disappointing.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><gmap_id>0x808f7e0ded47ff75:0x375cee5ad7c258cf< /gmap_id><Name>Harriet Russell< /Name><response>{'time': 1614626684459, 'text': 'Hi Harriet, Thank you for the feedback, we really do appreciate and will make sure to share with the staff.

Excellent service for a single diner. Outdoor seating available with social distance.  Well executed traditional Italian dishes.  The short rib was well seasoned & literally was so tender it fell off the bone.</Review>

<text>Excellent meal at this cozy neighborhood favorite. My husband and I shared an appetizer of grilled calamari with white beans and arugula. Very fresh tasting and the lemony dressing was perfect. We shared the delectable Sardinian pasta with various shellfish  for the second course, followed by the melt-in-your mouth braised beef short ribs. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the wines. We left it in his capable hands to pair a wine by the glass for each course.  We love to try new restaurants but both agreed we need to dine at this local standout more often!</text>< pictures>

My family had a terrific experience ordering delivery. All the instructions were followed correctly and the food was great. It was also great how they provided sides of freshly grated parmesan cheese for each entre. The bread was also excellent, normally I find bread from Italian restaurants is pretty forgettable but that was not the case here. I also enjoyed their unusual variations dishes that I haven't seen in other Italian restaurants. I will definitely be back.< /text>

<review>We ate there early in the evening and challenged the kid friendly reputation with our two year old twin grandsons. The kids split the braised short ribs and the gnocchi.  They loved it.  Two people had the pork chop and it was big wonderful and perfectly cooked. I had the calamari app and it was also fabulous and flavorful.

The service was warm, friendly and skilled.  It was a lovely dinner.  A great place to have so near where our daughter lives.  Thanks for a very nice meal.</review><Response>{'time': 1565635309963, 'text': 'Hi Michael, thank you so much for recommending us here on Google.

We‚Äôve been going to Bacco for years. The food is consistently delicious, especially the rigatoni. The risotto is the best in town. The owner and staff work hard and deliver excellent service. We‚Äôve brought many friends here and they‚Äôve all loved it. It‚Äôs truly a great neighborhood restaurant.<//text>

Amazing food always, and also convenient to be so close to our home.

Lamb shank, Rigatoni, and most likely everything on the menu that we tried were fabulous.<//Review>

Delicious! The beef rib was tender and flavorful and the gnocchi was even better - like little balls of happiness exploding in my mouth! Definitely recommend them if you want great Italian food.< /Review>

Love Bacco. The owner is welcoming, friendly, and she takes good care of her customers. Best Lasagna in SF. It's kid friendly, which is important for us as we have little ones to bring along. Great Noe Valley local Italian in the neighbourhood.</review>

We had dinner at Bacco last night and cannot recommend this place enough. Shari the owner was the perfect host - she was clearly passionate about the restaurant and her guests - fabulous.
The food was exceptional - the hand-made pasta was perfectly done, with flavours and ingredients well balanced and generous. Top this off with a great wine list with something for everyone and we will definitely be back for more.< /Review>

<review>I had a very pleasant experience. The food was very exceptional. Having spent some time in Italy myself (and having to eat out for every meal), I confidently found that the authenticity was unquestionable and very delicious. Another comment here mentioned octopus, which I had as an appetizer. If there was something I had to recommend in particular from my meal, this would surely be it.

I was also very pleased by the service. This was personally the second time I've been here ‚Äî first time being when I was probably in diapers when it just opened...so I was pretty much a new customer again. It was evident that there are returning customers, yet my table was given the same friendly and dedicated service as everyone else. We had constant communication and acknowledgement from the waiter and passing staff. The food tasted and was prepared in an upscale fashion, but the service was family-esque. Very complete restaurant, plan to go back.</review>< rate>

<text>Incredibly underwhelmed with this experience. I ordered take out over the phone and was quoted 20 minutes. I got there on time, was greeted after standing for a couple minutes. They asked me what name the order was under but I hadn't been asked for a name. The server disappeared for a moment, walked back out and didn't say anything to me. After another 5 minutes, a woman came out, said it would be a moment and then left. Another 10 minutes later and I finally got rung up, and the food was out in another 5. Total of 20 minutes of waiting. The woman I placed the order with most certainly forgot to put it in to the kitchen and didn't just explain the mistake and apologize. It was not busy enough for a 40 minute wait time to feel justified. There was little communication about my order and it overall felt pretentious and like I was not worth their time. The food was mediocre at best, I ordered the Ravioli and at the price of $21, I feel like I could have made better at home. The side of bread I was given was stale. Who the hell serves stale bread? According to the other reviews, the bread usually comes with a pesto dipping sauce for it. Never got any. I should have just taken the drive and gone to Spiazzo Ristorante in West Portal. Won't be coming back here again.< /text><UserId.>111699996784344627323< /UserId.>< user_name>

<date>1289712263886<//date><Text>A great neighborhood restaurant.  Always reliable Italian dishes.  We ate at Bacco again tonight, and the waiter could tell we wanted a quick dinner.  We were in and out in 35 minutes with a great meal.  Rigatoni, Gnocchi, Ravoli dishes have all been very good on various visits.  And the olive oil they provide with the bread is an excellent (and free!) starter.  The food and service isn't quite 5 star, but it's close.  Definitely recommended.< /Text></record>

The food was good - we had appetizers of eggplant mousse, grilled calamari, salumi, and 5 onion soup, and pans cotta - and it was expensive.   Two people, no wine and it was almost $75 before tip. The room is really nice and airy with calm lighting. The service is excellent. It's a step up from most of the neighborhood places in Noe Valley.</text>

<Review>Nicely decorated, good food but a little put off with slightly cold reception when my party first arrived.  Felt host was more concerned with Caucasian patrons than us (minority).  Waiter was a little abrupt when we tried to give him a count of how many cups of coffee we wanted, he preferred to count for himself.  The thing is, the whole restaurant experience also includes the type of service you get from the employee/owner. It's always nice when the host greets you warmly. So these comments have nothing to do with the food. The three stars reflex the attitudes of the employees.  For $76 a person serving 6 people, they should be nicer.<//Review>< Date>

You can't beat the combination of food, service, atmosphere, neighborhood, ...and did I say food?  If you don't get the Sacchetto, or Brasato, or Rigatoni, you're really missing out. Oh, and the risotto and fish specials are usually fantastic.  Great Italian wine list too.  Obviously, I love this place.</review>

Definitely our favorite Italian place in the city. The food is outstanding. And the wonderful wine list is priced reasonably because Lucca knows how to shop for great wine that isn't outrageously priced.< /Text>

<Review>Disappointed! One lovely server covering 2/3rds of the restaurant by herself meant painfully slow service. Food was bland and oily. Dunno what the fuss was all about here.

An out-of-the-way gem!  Tables far enough apart that you don't feel like you're at a baseball game.  Unusual menu items such as octopus (luscious!) and baccala (as good as the maitre d's grandmother used to make it).  An array of pasta dishes to suit a wide range of tastes.  Recommend the panna cotta and apple pastry dessert (similar to tarte tatin).  Modest-sized portions.  Professional, unobtrusive service.  An oasis in the urban bustle.<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Food was tasty and fresh, ordered their fregola pasta. Giving them 3 stars for their service felt rushed. We had to finish our food quickly so they could clear the table. We also felt rushed to order. #LetsGuide #italianfood

I ordered the fregola pasta which was good with fresh ingredients. The service was not good, we had to rush to eat and order. They speak Spanish #hablo

Visited the Duarte location. Gladys ran me up and she was super nice and helpful; she let me look at the ingredients list for all the sauces. It is a Vegan friendly fast food restaurant. Order a base of rice and/or veggies, and for the 'protein' order the crispy tofu (organic and non-gmo). Once you have your bowl, choose from any of their sauces, they are all vegan. ~ Me encanta esta compa√±√≠a de comida ligera, porque tienen una opci√≥n vegana. Se ordena una base de arroz o/y vegetales y para la prote√≠na se escoge el tofu (org√°nico). Ya con su comida, eliga entre cualquiera de las salsas porque todas son veganas.<//text>

<Review>Bowls and plates with choice of meat and type of rice. With or without veggies. Magic sauce is like teriyaki. Three different it sauce variations. My favorite is the beef but chicken is good as well. Service good and food was out quickly.<//Review>< Pictures>

I left and found a different flame broiler. They are the only flame broiler that charges extra for vegetables if you order the smallest size. So I said I would go to a different flame broiler and then asked for the restroom code to wash my hands and she said that it‚Äôs on the receipt. Ha ha. I‚Äôll never go to this place again.
Charging extra for veggies for a 5 oz?  Why???  New owner she said.< /text>

<text>I have to say today I'm disappointed in the quality of my food. When this place first opened everything was delicious nothing was over or under cooked it was on point. Today my brown rice was undercooked I had bits and bits of hard rice in really couldn't enjoy my food. My beef was burnt and my wife's chicken was burnt. The quality really dropped here it's either the cook they have suck! Or they changed product vendors! Which would explain the quality. I wont be coming back unless they deal with this issue!!<//text><Time>1540586717341< /Time>< Pictures>

It is Friday July 5th, 2019 2:38pm I just left there and the service was good can‚Äôt complain about that but the place was empty so didn‚Äôt expect less. But the food was terrible, veggies on my bowl were cold, rice was not cooked right, and it was just not good. I ordered a chicken mini bowl. Also the soda fountain needs maintenance ASAP!! Some weird rubbery thing came out of the ice dispenser and none of the drinks taste right not even the coke! Idk about other frame broilers but this one is a no go üòùüòùüòù<//text>

The best place to go for New Wave music, apparel and a whole lot more. Posters to Pins to Car Window Decals and many collectibles. Ask for Ray, he's the guru of Kaos Records in Covina.< /Review>

They have rare bands shirts! The staff is very courteous and attentive to customers.  It beats the drive to Hollywood for shopping. It's small but you'll bec amazed at what you will find. Awesome selection of T shirts and back patches.<//text>

This place is nice. A lot of records and band shirts. You need to go in with the state of mind that you will be sorting through records which is nice. You can go in and trade records. They offer new and used records. When I went the girl working the counter was VERY sweet and helpful. Definitely coming back.<//text>

<text>Amazing place! Good selection of psychobilly, punk, and new wave. Love the stickers, and patches. Also the 2 for $1 pins are to die for!
And this is a great place to see flyers for up coming shows. My favorite place!< /text>< time>

A truly unique and epicly (epically?) awesome record store! They have a wide selection of all the stuff you want that's HARD TO FIND. I'm glad I live local to this one... perfect place for all your oldschool music needs!

Also, I'd like to add details of an actual experience. I was to see Depeche Mode in May 2018. I really wanted the Violator hoodie to go with me, but... they didn't have my size. BUT, They ordered it for me and it was ready for pickup just minutes before I arrived to check on that! Also got some Decals for the car. Overall, 100‚òÜs this place rocks!<//review>

We had our first office visit our our little dog Rasty.  First impression?  The place was spotless and utterly immaculate...we were greeted by two gracious and efficient persons at the counter (I regret the I failed to get their names).

We were escorted to an examination room, also spotless, and greeted by a very kind and pleasant vet tech, Jovani (sp) who efficiently filled out paperwork and prepared our pet for the examination to follow.

Within minutes, Dr. Chen appeared and gave Rasty a thorough checkup and her required vaccine booster shot.  He also was the epitome of caring professionalism, and our crazy little dog responded to him with affection...a true test, eh?

We are delighted with the care, the cleanliness, and the compassion of the entire team...our gratitude is boundless...We feel very fortunate to have found them.<//Review>

<Text>The El Camino Veterinary Hospital was able get Brandy our border collie in right way for her medical issue, which took a lot off of my mind.  They offered animal heath insurance which helped with our cost towards Brandy's treatment.  I felt cared for as they cared for Brandy.  She is on the mend now and walking around the house looking for someone to play with her. :) Much Thanks to the staff! RLM< /Text><user_id>109747218221631731628<//user_id>< pics>

<text>We feel very confident in taking our fur babies to this Veterinary hospital. The staff are always nice and the vet techs are always very caring.  I have taken my fur babies here since 2011. They loving cared for my sick fur baby that unfortunately had an untreatable illness and passed away. They not only took care of him but also us.
On our recent visit our little girl was having problems and did not want the Tech to come near. She had a low soft growl, the Tech got on the floor and patiently waited for her to come to him.  She then was at ease.  They helped us to ease her pain, now she is running around like she was a puppy again!
Thank You, to all the staff at El Camino Veterinary Hospital.</text></record>

<Text>Everyone who works here from the front desk to the techs and doctor are super awesome, sweet, and truly compassionate people. I always sadly have a budget to crunch when I go in there and with my cat getting up in years I've gotten fairly familiar with all the folks at this clinic. They are always willing to work with what I have in whatever way is possible, while helping my critters feel better. I absolutely love and appreciate every single person that works here and always leave feeling incredibly grateful. Thank you all for all that you do. These people make a huge difference in our lives and I'm so grateful.</Text>< Pics>

Loved finding a vet with evening hours and was amazed to get a same day appointment. From the person who I spoke with on the phone...to being checked in...to the vet assistant who took our dog's vital signs...to the doctor....everyone was very professional and very caring.  They immediately were able to diagnose what was wrong with our pet, prescribed the proper medicine and put her on the road to health quickly.  Our dog is once again happy and healthy.  Thank you, El Camino Vet!</review>

<Text>Last week, our Black Lab of almost 13 years old was in really bad shape. I tried to call her regular veterinarian, but he wouldn't be in in that afternoon. I searched the web and read some reviews and called El Camino Veterinary Hospital, made the appointment for 2 hours later. The front desk person was really nice and explained all the options and prices for us. The veterinarian made a examination and explain all our questions in a very sincere way. Since we didn't want our dog to suffer anymore, we made the option for euthanasia. : (  He also told us that we could say our goodbyes to our sweet Lucy and after the process was done we could stay a little longer in the room with her. The place is clean, the staff is really nice and very accommodating and yesterday we receive a "Thinking of You" card from the staff of El Camino Vet. Hospital. I thought that it was a good reason besides the well care that was given to Lucy to write a review. Thank you very much for your kindness.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809adbef2dff0b55:0x81db853865f5c783</Gmap_id></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This hospital has a very welcoming staff, they are always polite and helpful. I can always call them and ask a question whenever I have any concerns without actually coming in.
Dr. Morgan is very experienced and he has on many occasions saved me money because I happen to be an overreacting person. He recommends the necessary treatment without pushing the extra expenses by telling me about the options I can do myself at home.
I also happened to get Dr. Perry once, who listened to my rambling with no complaints, was very caring and professional. Dr. Perry also had helpful suggestion for dental care, which is never an issue until it's too late, so the advice was definitely a big plus.
The vet techs are supportive, enjoy the company of your pet and love what they do, they always handle my cats with love and care. People tend to overlook the techs but trust me they do a lot of work and spend the most time with your pets!
My cats have been here for over a year and so far so good! I've asked a ton of questions every time I came in about shots, type/brand of food, litter, deworming, spaying etc. I've also visited them when they used to do emergency visits, back in the day.
I'm not going to lie, there are cheaper vet offices out there, but really not by that much. They also offer a free follow up appointment, which is definitely worth mentioning. You can schedule an appointment for free up to 10 days or so later as long as it is for the same issue, to re-examine and check the progress.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Went here in Jan 2020 to get my dog's annual shots of taken care of. She is very friendly with people and she shrank into me and my spouse as soon as the Dr. came in dressed in extra protective arm and hand gear and stated she had experience with aggressive dogs and was clearly acting nervous despite her copious explanations of experience. We were both taken aback at this comment and asked why she assumed our Staffordshire Terrier was aggressive.  She could not give us an answer. Our dog became more and more nervous as she explained they'd need to concoct a substitute for one of the shots since it was not in stock and it would be administered to the mouth via a needleless shot. We explained our dog became frightened when foreign objects were brought near her face. We tried to help administer the drug (laying on the floor at one point) with no success until finally one of the assistants suggested putting it with food which worked well. This of course was after our dog was traumatized (and only worked after the Dr. left the room). We will not be returning.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Had to take our dog of 15 years in today. We knew this day was coming, but dreaded to have her put down. Ricky at the front desk was great. Dr. Chen examined her and agreed that it was time to have her put down. Dr. Chen was very compassionate and sensitive to our needs. He explained the process from start to finish in great detail. We stayed with her until she fell asleep.The staff was GREAT. If we get another  pet in the future, I will absolutely go back to El Camino Vet.  The staff made a difficult time for us MUCH easier.< /text>

We have been taking our Scottie, Lucy, to El Camino Veterinary for about 10 years. The staff at El Camino is always very courteous and helpful with our needs. Dr. Morgan and all the other resident DVM‚Äôs are very professional and always provide the best care and options when discussing our Pet‚Äôs needs. I highly recommend El Camino to anyone looking for a new Veterinary.<//text>

<review>This is the first time I have ever taken a pet of mine to a Vet. I didn't know what to expect but I'm so glad I found this place. I was a bit late to my appointment but they seen my pet almost as soon as we got there. The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and inviting. My dog had an allergic reaction from what we think could've been a bee sting or spider bite of some sort, and her face was swollen. The exam and a shot she needed (which helped her get better!!) totaled to $71 something. The prices were lower than what I expected and I am so impressed with the fact that I can bring my dog back a few days after she's been seen to make sure shes okay, free of charge! Plus, Zoey got a treat on our way out. I will recommend this clinic to anyone and everyone and will be returning if and whenever needed. Thank you for the great first time experience!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
After finding EC Vet Hospital during a scary weekend emergency last Spring, I decided to make my dog's regular wellness checkup and vaccine appointment with them this month. Once again my interactions with Drs  Smartt and Morgan were pleasant, professional and informative. Their manner of handling my large but often nervous dog was very compassionate and patient. Prices are quite reasonable for the high degree of care and the range of available appointment hours surpasses most private practices I've found. We have definitely found a new vet and I could not be happier with or not confident in my choice.< /Review>

My visit was competely unexpected. I had accompanied a friend with her sick pup. He had eaten rat poison. I know this is second hand info but if I owned a pet i can assure you this is where i would bring it for any of my pets needs. They were friendly fast and informative. My friend came a hott mess and left happy and quite confident she would return the next day for her precious Howie just as he was before. And as you would know it she did! Thanks to all those great vets.<//text>

Love you guys.

<text>This vet hospital is the worst ever!!! When I got there with my injured dog they told me it was $120 for an exam, just an exam with no x-rays or anything involved. So they kept making everything more expensive after they found out we only had 120 on us. Are they stupid or something, if we say we only have 120 on us then you don't raise the price to 450+ & then 2,100. They were nice to us when we first went in there but when they found out we only so much money on us they were treating us very rudely. They don't care about you or your pets, they just care about money and are a money hungry business. Later I found a vet clinic that only cost $25 dollars for an exam, the same exact exam I paid $120 for. SHAME ON THEM!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME BACK TO THIS TERRIBLE VETERINARY CLINIC!!!!!</text>< pics>

<review>They are trying to say I 'owe them money' for examinations that never happened. I brought my cats in and they brought them directly to the back (It was suppose to be an emergency visit.) I was referred to go there because I had just gotten fired and was waiting for my EDD to come through, I told them this, because I believe honesty is best. They put my application through to see if I qualified for the payment plan (Care Credit, I believe?) and kept telling me there was nothing they could do until It could be verified. They told me how scared my cats were adn that they were looking for me. When I was denied care credit, they told me there was nothing they could do but send me home with my cats and that the night would be the deciding factor if they would make it. I asked the vet if there was anything at home I could do, he suggested a few things. and that was it. So when did they examinations happen? Was it when my cats were in the back and they were telling me there wasn't anything they could do until approved for Care Credit? Do NOT go here. Not worth it, and they charge you for absolutely nothing. I will be fighting this charge because there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DONE for my cats. No exam, nothing. I didn't even know what was wrong until the next day when a nice vet (with a coupon for free exams, thank god) saw them.

I took my puppy there on 11/12/15 and they charged me 100 for the emergency visit and then they charged me another 73 to take the parvo test on him and they said it was negative at that point my baby was already extremely weak and then the girl in the front desk came to say they would refund me some money and only charge me for a normal app after that they took about half an hour if not more to figure out what they can do to help him when they came back they charge was so high that I knew it wasn't so I decided to leave and take him else where he was only getting wors.. I took him to a vet place a few blocks down and they said just by the symptoms and the way the puppy looked they knew it was parvo and that it was too late to try and safe him but they would do the best the plans they gave me were half of what they said here and it was a more extensive plan but unfortunately before I signed my puppy had already passed away....!!!!!!!

< Review>
The emergency vet Dr. Chen failed to notice a mass in my 2 year old cat's abdomen when I brought him in due to lack of appetite, and prescribed my cat suffering from a liver failure antibiotics for a mouth infection (which I suspected was the cause but I took him to a veterinarian because I am not one.) He essentially prescribed my cat poison that killed him. Granted he was 2 and not obese, so lipidosis was a fluke. I did express concern over his lethargy and failure to eat as well as vomiting and called when he continued to vomit, they said his appetite should come back after the antibiotics and I trusted them. Having a feeling that El Camino may not be a very good vet, I took him to Midtown animal hospital a few days later (as soon as I could get an appointment) when the antibiotics were making him vomit worse. Midtown noticed a massive liver immediately and then confirmed this on an X-ray then referred me to VCA referral emergency hospital in Rancho Cordova, because they don't do intensive care there, and told me about CARE credit because their services are very expensive (but worth it.) So I am struggling to get my cat seen by the real emergency veterinary service now to find out if it is in any way treatable. My cat is now yellow with jaundice and in hospital. Meanwhile, it is force feeding to keep him from going downhill too painfully and pain meds and many costly diagnostics. Don't waste your money here on subpar veterinary services - go somewhere that the vets are not negligent and just trying to sell you something that may or may not help then get you out the door instead of this horrible place. Dr. Chen is negligent and does not care about your pet.

Update: My beloved cat died, $5000 in debt later of what would have been a very treatable disease if caught earlier by a competent vet. I wasted $150 on incompetent diagnosis and would consider suing them in small claims court if I were not moving out of state next week. They did not offer to reimburse me for their misdiagnosis and negligence. They are the one vet that did not send a sympathy card of the 3 we went to in this ordeal too. Not that any amount of money can ever replace my Vlad cat. I cry myself to sleep at night and kick myself every day for going there because it had good reviews, was close and was the only emergency vet I knew about at the time. We lost precious days that might have made a difference by being steered wrong here and believing that he "would be fine after antibiotics." and that the throwing up was "no big deal" and would soon stop. That would probably work most of the time, but if you are a veterinarian, you should rule out anything catastrophic with a simple blood test and not prescribe an antibiotic with a side effect of nausea without anti-emetics and appetite stimulants to a cat that won't eat, from what other vets I took my cat to subsequently when trying to save him have said. Of course I wanted to believe that he didn't need any of that. That cat meant a lot to me, and laid by my side every day when I was recovering from a miscarriage and found out I can never have children. Don't lose your beloved pet by trusting incompetent vets who do not know what to feel for in the abdomen and tell you 'blood tests aren't necessary' when your pet is sick. Of course you want to believe that your pet is okay and to trust a vet, but I'd rather pay for real diagnostics than go somewhere that will guess and lie, pretending to know what they are doing. Go to a real emergency vet! (VCA or Davis.) I will definitely be filing a complaint.<//Review>

<Review>I had a great experience dealing with BLS LA Car Leasing & Sales. From my first initial call - the team was very responsive and asked detailed questions in order to tailor fit my request. Once at the premises, no time was wasted and I was immediately presented with the best options that suited my needs and the sale process and customer service was fantastic. All in all, I had a very positive seamless experience. I strongly recommend their services.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>My family uses BLS for all their leases.

Ben is one of the most candid people you can work with.

Straight to the point gets you the best price the first time and will deliver and do all the hard work.

I‚Äôve worked with other brokers before but no one has been as professional, hardworking, and truthful as Ben.

Highly recommended BLS!< /Review><user>116343855472296767217<//user><response>None</response><rating>5<//rating>< name>

My wife and I were shopping around for some leases over the holidays. We were getting decent prices but we were not satisfied with the prices we were receiving.

A friend recommended BLS LA and my wife and I thought why not?

Ben was able to get us the exact vehicle I wanted for a fraction of the cost. Our down payment was VERY reasonable for the price we are paying monthly.

Highly recommend these guys! 5 stars all the way<//text>

BLS car leasing is great at what they do.  They will find you the best price they are the type of guy if you can't find you the best price he will tell you to go with the person that gave you the better number he won't waste your time and you can always call him and check if the price you have is the best price or if they can do any better 95% of the time they will find you a better price!<//Text>

BEN IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Not only did he find me my baby in one day, but he also found me the CHEAPEST deal by far. I went to so many dealerships and none even came close. Not only does Ben get you a dream car but he also sets you up with the most amazing customer service. If you need a vehicle and a dope experience-please hit him up!</review>

<review>I cannot fault Stacey and his team.  From the first meeting I had over the phone with Inga to the completion of the process, it is hard to find fault.  Both people I spoke with, were very professional, knowledgeable and helped me to understand the importance of online testimonials via video.

I highly recommend this company if you are looking for solutions with growing your business on line.  I am very impressed with my video that they put together for me and will definitely recommend them to other business owners, looking to add more value to their business.</review>< pictures>

I like a good value. My contact there (I assume to keep personal information private) was helpful by offering me the opportunity to get my name out there at an extremely fair cost. The fact that I will get a marketing strategy upon completion is awesome. She was very professional and helpful, knowledgeable,and conducted herself with utmost integrity.</Text>

Steve Young has done a wonderful job in helping me promote my dental business. His company worked very professionally in producing a video concerning my patients reviews of their experiences in my office. His work is highly organized and very much to the point. He is extremely knowledgeable concerning new marketing techniques, which were very time efficient, informative & helpful. I highly recommend the services of this company to increase your business visibility.</review>

<text>I would highly recommend Steve and the services his company offers.  He is creative and does the kind of "out of the box" thinking that will make your company successful.  He is in charge of my organic and maps SEO marketing campaign.  As a Plastic Surgeon, targeted search is a very key component of my business strategy and visibility is paramount.  After interviewing several different companies, I knew Steve was my man.  Thank you Steve.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Very informative presentation and a very valuable program for anyone looking to find the right clients for their business. After spending hours at networking meetings, I can see that this program has the potential for really targeting the audience I want to reach quickly and efficiently.

It was pleasant, informative, educational, easy, pretty quick, and I felt like my time was spent in a valuable manner. There was no pressure, no attempt at bait and switch, no hard upsell -- just information to help me make my own informed decisions. If I had not felt comfortable, I would have bailed at the first sign of pressure. I am looking forward to seeing the results and I have a feeling my marketing dollars will not go into a black hole.<//Review>

I was very impressed with IYP's professionalism and quick responses to questions and requests. After viewing the first production draft, I requested a change. IYP gladly made the change and had another production draft ready for my review within just a couple of hours. All the changes were made and the final product looked great.<//Text>

< Review>
I can't say enough good things about IYP. They are the real deal and have taken my reputation from almost nothing to 5 Stars in a few months... now all I do is tell people to go online and compare reputations between my competitors and me ... game over! My closing ratio is over 90% now... I highly highly recommend these guys.</Review>

<Text>I did not know what to expect, since the video isnt done in a studio. I was taken thru the concept and schedule of events thoroughly and promptly by Steve. The ease of the process is paramount in making me feel like this strategy is bulletproof. The analysis of my web presence, looking at the website and FB/twitter pages, online reviews, and general digital presence is also a great bonus. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, Steve points out another angle that sheds light and exposes your weakness. Great for the novice and the expert!! What else do you expect from a US MARINE!!!))<//Text>< UserId.>

This was eye opening!  I've been struggling with my internet marketing, spending significant sums and not getting results.
What Steve is saying makes a lot of sense.  I'm looking forward to putting a new internet marking plan in place.</Text>

I don't care what anyone says this place has consistently turned out awesome work! After over 15 years and thousands of washing his works has not faded away. Jimmy's work is awesome and quality is top notch! Thank you Jimmy for helping us out AGAIN you rock!<//Text>

Our church shirts needed a logo on them - Jimmy Jam put on the logo which was so perfect - clear, colorful and beyond my expectations.  This is the best place ever.  Not to mention nice people and a great price. I am going to go back.< /review>

This company customer service is so poor and unprofessional. I was shocked by the treatment of management and the support team. I ordered 60 items. I paid the requested 75% deposit on my original order. I called the day my order was suppose to be finished. Only to be told they were unsure and would call me back. I never received a call. When I called back, I was told my order was ready. When I went to pick up my order I only received 54 pieces. Once it was confirmed the order was incomplete. I was told to pay another 75% deposit on the items that were missing. I was shocked. I was also told to pay the order in full and would receive my missing items a week later. I was visibly upset. The owner then told me its Friday and he refused to deal with his error. I refused to pay a 75% deposit on items I've already paid for! The owner told me there's the door and I could use it freely and he would not deal with his mistake. This business should be ashamed. I will never do business here again. If you decide to do business here, please stay on top of your order and the people who work here.</Review>

I purchase T shirts and the screens from them a few years ago, they told me once I pay the set up fee when I come back I don't have to purchase it again. The building caught on fire and they temporarily move to another location. When I pick up the T shirts they did not give me my screens or inform me that I needed to take the screens with me. Now a few years later I came back to purchase more shirts, they told me I need to pay a set up fee, I said check your records I already did that. The owner was very argumentative, I said sir I'm not trying to fight you I am a return customer please check your records. So he found that I was telling the truth and on the receipt it said give customer the screens. Very kindly I told him you never inform me of that, this guy was just rude rude , instead of working with me he continue to fight. Not the kind of people I want to do business with.  He admitted I was right and offer me a discount but , there was no discount the set up fee was still 80 dollars and he charge me 50 dollars more if I wanted the shirts by a certain time. He said the set up fee is 80 dollars and then he switch to 100 dollars. This guy is a joke and his only concern is money he don't care about customer service. I will never do busy with that company!< /text>

<Review>I was referred here by another parent for shirts for my youth group and GOD do I regret going to this place. This guy is ARROGANT and so UNPROFESSIONAL. I do not care about your photo on the wall with Snoop and other rappers you've done some work for. He is very short with his answers like he's annoyed. I'm not the professional, you're SUPPOSED to be so if I have questions then you answer them so I can make an informed purchase. Don't see how this douche is still in business.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Just wanted to say THANK YOU!!!! My shirt selection/design was a hit! Almost think I should have ordered more aprons, they were in high demand!!!!

All of this was possible because you did/do great work! One lady stopped me in the parking lot to ask me where I got my shirts done. Jimmy Jams in LA off of Main!

If I ever need anything done in the future, I'll be sure to come see you first.</review>

1 STAR is a privilege. This is the most unprofessional establishment I've ever been to. It took JIMMY a week to print on (T W O)  YES 1,2.. two t-shirts and kept making us wait hours when we'd arrive. I came to pick up on 2 separate occasions and it still wasn't ready. He kept saying come tomorrow. We WET HOME DISAPPOINTED HOPING HE'D HAVE THEM READY THE NEXT DAY. We went the next day just as he said and he'd say call before you come. He Had no recollection of the file name he SAVED OUR IMAGES under that he was supposed to be working on for us which meant that he had NEVER STARTED. Jimmy is nonchalant and don't care about much it shows in his work--poor work ethic is an understatement. He made us sit there for about 4-5 hours waiting and the printing came out horrible. My boyfriend had to actually help him print on the tees as he has the knowledge already, but not the equipment. It was a disaster. Don't waste your time or money. I saw a few roaches in there too. YUCK.<//text>

Asked for a rush order and it came out crappy. They emailed me the day of my pick up saying something is wrong with my artwork and they needed me to resend it. The finish of the logos I got printed came out terrible. They were peeling off. I don't recommend this place.< /Text>

This is the worst most unprofessional business in this profession, in the city of L.A. in my opinion. Furthermore their work is not that great to be 1 in 20 t-shirt business within a one mile radius so I don't know how they stay in business.<//Text>

We both had the steak & unlimited shrimp. They were good about keeping the shrimp coming which was surprising because normally restaurants are slow to bring out refills, hoping you don't eat as much. The steak was cooked to order but was extremely tough to chew.</review>

The food was medium quality. The portions were small, and the price was ridiculously high. The servers were very nice, luckily.< /Review>

Everything was underwhelming. The menu options are scant which makes them only marginally better than the actual food. If you're looking to pay $15-20 per person for food you can get from your grocery store freezer then this is your place.< /Review>

<review>There's a couple of things I don't like about sizzler in general and one is that when you order your meal they don't bother to tell you the drink has to be paid for. They say okay you want this for dinner and what do you want to drink. And then charge you about $3 for the drink it used to be free. The other thing is it we could make our own salads had to make a list of what you wanted. That was brought to the table and that's the last we ever saw of our server our drinks were empty and never to be refilled. I normally always leave a tip but because I thought the service was so bad this is the first time I haven't left the tip. This is not typical service I expected is sizzler. But it is the typical way they end up selling you a drink in a misleading way. Chuck-A-Rama gives you the drink with a meal and quite frankly I think their meals are better than sizzlers but we didn't have an Chuck-A-Rama here in Auburn<//review>< pics>

Service so so we waited and waited until finally I asked some guy cleaning the tables if he had any idea how long it would take for food or if waitresses even came into this area?  Mind you you walk in and place a order.I had totally finished my salad before this arrived to my husband. Not very hard messing up a piece of lobster a baked potato you're cooking a steak medium rare and topping it with mushrooms but the quality of your sirloin lousy! you should allow an upgrade for a better piece of meat. I now know why we haven't eaten at Sizzler in 20 years<//Review>

We don't eat here more than a few times a year, but always enjoy it when we do.  We often have Christmas dinner here, which is fun.  We also ate here on New Year's Day, and Kim, our server,was terrific, as are all the staff we've encountered.   We like the senior meal deals, along with a glass of wine.  Steaks always cooked to our liking.< /Review>

Decent food, choices and amounts for the money, especially the salad bar. Being a vegetarian, I always get the salad bar, which includes a soup and dessert bar. They also have steak and shrimp to order.  The dining area is large with booths, tables and porch area. It is usually not crowded or noisy. It's a good place to sit and visit with friends for hours and not get rushed out because they need a table.<//Text>

I usually love this sizzler, but this time the salad bar was not as good as usual.I really love the chicken wings they have in the salad bar and I always look forward to them but when I went this time there were only four chicken wings there and when I went back for a second plate there were still none.I decided to just go with salads and when I use the blue cheese dressing it was very watered-down and so was the ranch. Usually I love everything in the salad bar.</Review>

Sizzler is a known quantity for a great value: good food at a good price. The restaurant in Auburn, California is located just off the Interstate, just east of the historic Gold Rush era downtown.

My fraternity had one of their annual dinner meetings there, and although menu items improve through time, their standard steak and shrimp dinner with rice pilaf and a cold brew beckoned. Why fix/change something if it isn't broken?

Our group makes sure the wait staff are duly rewarded for bringing our meals, providing beverages and add-ons, and bussing the tables. Prompt friendly service with good dining. Give them a visit next time you're near.<//Review>

Salad bar excellent!! Salad bar alone is worth going there. Steaks are good, well seasoned and tender, Malibu Chicken was overcooked and dry. Hot bar/taco bar looked unappetizing as it looked like many items were sitting in the hot table awhile. Soups were very good, and dessert bar was also very good with a lot of varieties. Service very good and prompt<//Review>

<Text>I've always been a big fan of the endless sp and salad bar at Sizzler. For the most part today was no different. Loved the clam chowder and the salads I was able to make. Lots of choices for toppings and even the type of lettuce. The fried chicken which we normally love however was a little overdone today. But the bread and honey butter they bring to the table was excellent. Had a very nice meal with family from out of state.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Rate>4< /Rate>< gmap_id>

This is one of the best! For about a decade there I gave up on Sizzler, but this location specifically restored my faith. Best steak I have had in a restaurant in a very long time.< /Text>

<Review>Salad bar is pretty great but dont expect your steak to be cooked to your requested doneness. I asked for medium rare and got medium well. My husband's, slightly thicker steak was good though. I will still return, just might get a burger though. Or just salad bar. Very nice remodel since I'd been there too.</Review>< userid>

Unfortunately, Sizzler is not what it used to be. We were there for dinner and the Spanish rice and pasta looked like it had been there since morning. While we were eating, an 87 year old man fell once outside the restaurant and the staff would not call 911. They were asked twice to dial it, but would not. That's not cool.....</Review>

A little prices are a little high. But over all good food. Took a while with the line to get in. But over all it was good. And they really have doggy bags. They are cute. But kind of odd to wrap your food up in.</Text>

Had not been to a Sizzler in years.  I had the Senior 6 oz  sirloin steak.  It comes with a plated salad, one side & a drink for $10.99.  If you sign up for their E  Club,  a few days later you get a coupon for a free classic burger & side.  I would get the steak again.< /Text>

<Review>If you just want a salad by itself you can't beat it. You would have to have a $100- worth of vegetables all cleaned and raw on hand at home, no way, they would go bad before I could eat them all. It is buffet style for all the veggies. You make the salad yourself and you can have seconds if you want. Also included are fresh fruits and salads, like seafood, macaroni,  tuna and more! Part of the deal is you can make tacos included and some pasta and meatballs with a marinara sauce, fried chicken wings, cobbler, soft serve ice cream,  it's all included, can't beat it. Making myself hungry.<//Review>< resp>

Meals on wheels for those who still have wheels! Wish they would put more effort into the steaks and a little less on all you can eat salad bar. Still the mature crowd needs a place to go. So thanks for that.</review>

My first trip to a Sizzler in over 4 years and it was well worth it. The food was great and so was the customer service.  Had a great server, Charlie, and the ladies working the registers were fantastic, Kim and crew. Would highly recommend this Sizzler in Auburn.<//review>

I found a feather attached to one of my chicken wings. All the manager could say was "it's chicken, what's the problem". Call me crazy but I would prefer my food not to look like it should still be running around clucking. It totally ruined my meal. I'll never go back there.<//Text>

<review>Each year when I visit my dad in Auburn, I simply must make one or more trips to Sizzler for the salad bar. Really great selection of salad stuff, along with other things that I never have room to eat. They offer a nice senior discount, too. The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is very clean, recently remodeled. There's an area that can be reserved for large group meetings, too.< /review>< Pics>

I haven't been to sizzler for a few years. I went for the salad bar and was really disappointed. For the two of us it was $33 for two salad bars and one iced tea. The pickings were slim. We usually only make one trip to the bar and perhaps a cup of soup. The service was very good and our server was very efficient. We probably won't be going back to sizzler, as we can find salad many other places at a much lower cost. This isn't particular to this one restaurant, but rather sizzler in general.< /Review>

I only give this 3 stars because for a shrimp dinner with baked potato, roll and a drink the bill was $51 and some change for the two of us. We used to get a one time trip to the salad bar for an extra $3.99, but they have done away with that. So, you pay for unlimited salad bar $6.50. The dessert selection was horrible, and the shrimp was very greasy. I will say that the service was excellent and the wait staff were very helpful. While we were ordering, no one asked us or offered us the senior discount even though we are obviously seniors. All in all - not the worst place I have eaten, but certainly overpriced for the food. We should have just gone with the salad bar and called it good.< /Review>

Terrible food,  terrible service! All you can eat steak and shrimp means what you get whats on your plate and that all you get to eat! No seconds on shrimp cuz your waitress is going to disappear. Leather like steaks. Have someone that knows the heimlich procedure with you cuz choking on the drizzly meat is a guarantee!
One star is more then they deserve!</Review>

I only give this 3 stars because for a shrimp dinner with baked potato, roll and a drink the bill was $51 and some change for the two of us. We used to get a one time trip to the salad bar for an extra $3.99, but they have done away with that. So, you pay for unlimited salad bar $6.50. The dessert selection was horrible, and the shrimp was very greasy. I will say that the service was excellent and the wait staff were very helpful. While we were ordering, no one asked us or offered us the senior discount even though we are obviously seniors. All in all - not the worst place I have eaten, but certainly overpriced for the food.

Food was good but I got food poisoning (I think from the taco bar). The cheesy bread is particularly good, and the salad bar has a pretty nice selection of toppings and dressings</text>

So much wrong with this place.  Has a smell when you walk in.  The clam chowder had a brown film over it.  Pasta looked like it had been sitting there for hours.  Chocolate pudding had a green tint to it.  Food out of the kitchen seemed okay...but the salad bar needed a lot of attention.< /Review>

My trip was during dinner time, plenty of parking, no line when we went in. We were greeted when we walked in, the woman took our order, gave us our drinks and plates (we got the salad bar ) and were told to sit where we like. The food was good no complaints but the plates we received had food stuck on them, when given a new set they also had food on them. The waitress was a little rude about the complaint,  she also vacuumed during our entire visit only stopping when someone got her attention. I don't know if I would visit this sizzle again.< /Review>

<Review>A nice Sizzler, friendly and accommodating staff. Our recent visit had a couple issues like the steak was cooked not to what was ordered  (but we ate it anyway ) and the large bottle of Tabasco was missing it's inner spout so it just gushed sauce all over the soup, but we pointed it out to the server and she thanked us for pointing that out and took the bottle so it would not happen again. Overall a nice and clean restaurant and ample parking.< /Review>< Rate>

A nice Sizzler, friendly and accommodating staff. Our recent visit had a couple issues like the steak was cooked not to what was ordered  (but we ate it anyway ) and the large bottle of Tabasco was missing it's inner spout so it just gushed sauce all over the soup, but we pointed it out to the server and she thanked us for pointing that out and took the bottle so it would not happen again. Overall a nice and clean restaurant and ample parking.<//text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Had not been in many years. Used to go a lot as a kid, and few times as a teenager, but went back with the family and was disappointed.

It wasn't bad, but the price-to-awesome ratio was skewed more towards the price side of things. We spent more, and didn't get to leave with leftovers!

Taco fixings we're meh, cheap and old. At one point the soups did not at all match the labels, but then they did upon return. Out of chocolate ice cream, which made the kids sad.

Overall, not enough deliciousness to warrant the price. Could have ordered a variety of things elsewhere, left with leftovers, and still have spent the same or less. Food would have been awesome acrissed the board instead of "oh, this must been sitting awhile."

The kids had more fun at the Chinese buffet place in Grass Valley, and we spent less, and the wife and felt the overall quality was about the same.< /Review>< Pics>

It was ok, the steak was flash cooked and needed seasoning which I rarely use.  The bread was good but a little undercooked in the middle.  For the price paid I'd probably go someplace else next time.<//Review>

<Text>Absolute worst meal I've ever had in my life. I paid for 2  buffets at a price 0f 30$ and what little there was out to choose from was nearly all cold( like taco fixings, mac and cheese, chicken wings things that shouldn't be). Now I noticed there weren't many people there but my family party of nearly 50 but I nearly went back to the front to ask for my money back we had maybe 3 bites between us and the waitress took our entire trays because it was literally inedible. I do have to mention they did bring out a fresh bowl of warm mac and cheese for my sister and gave us a basket of rolls which was one a price so I got one cold bite of food and one roll for 30$. This is unacceptable.<//Text>< Response>

Stopped by this location on the way home from Reno.   Restaurant is very clean and organized, but they seemed understaffed that morning.   Regardless, our server hustled and kept our party well stocked with salad plates and bowls and checked up on us regularly.   Food came out slowly, but still, everything was great.< /review>

< Review>
I have been going here for years. It's been a favorite, however, my last visit was very disappointing. The man taking our order put more effort into second guessing us instead of listening and my entr√©e  wasn't edible due to the nasty canned gravy poured over it. Thank goodness for the salad bar.<//Review>

Most of the food was stale or had a strange taste. Brought it up to the manager and she didn't seem to care, but thanked us for letting her know. Don't plan on going back anytime soon.</Text>

< review>
I feel like I just got sold a sh_tty used car. How about getting charged for a salad bar because she braved a couple of bites of truly wretched pudding. Oh and she made a taco at the buffet section which was laid out like it was for everybody. SO: $5.99 for one salad bar and $6.99 for the other one (I guess it‚Äôs a subjective/random pricing strategy)...ALSO-$3.99
for soup bar. $19.99 for a very ordinary ribeye...
$18.99 for my BLAH tri-tip (st least I think it was
tri-tip). &2.69 for coffee & $2.99 for iced tea.
All told, pre-tip the bill came to $64 and change.
And darn, I can‚Äôt even drive it home!</review>

Food quality same as always, about a 7 on a 10 scale!

My server was very nice.

Unfortunately, girl @ the order counter was unprofessional, rude,no customer service skills.

Kind of ruins the whole dining experience< /text>

<Text>Horrible! We came in as a party of four each ordered an entree and the salad bar. Not only did they forget my plate, but when we told them hey your missing a plate, they told me i was wrong even though we paid for it! Then they decided to add my entree as a side to some one elses plate. And when i told them about it, our server was rude! And then we ask for a manager and she did NOTHING to resolve the issue. Didnt make sense because they didnt forget my soda! Or the fact thar we were charged!  How do u see four people and completely ignore one person? I have never eaten at sizzlers before and i can guarantee the only time i will ever come again is to out buy every store just to put this outrageous store out of business or to reteach their cashiers busers and servers what friendliness and some actual class can do for them. Better yet such horrible service is bound to put themselves out of business and who knows if the food is worth it .   .I guess this is why they stay in the lower class brackets and why i never go . Complete trash ..id rather dine at home town buffet, their servers and busers have more respect! And im not a fan of their resterant either .... I guess im so suprised and angry because i have never had been told i was wrong for pointing out hey you got my soda but for got my plate and they looked at me like i was wrong? What is wrong with these people?! And the manager said it was odd they messed up and she would resolve the issue .. but i never got my full entree or to really try the soup or salad or the dessert ..but we paid for it. Totally speaking with their district manager and i will certainly never dine their and yes im thinking of calling the news station this place was that disrespectful .Any one else go to a resterant to drink soda only? And pay for food you wont eat? I didnt think so .  i guess this is why no one really recomends sizzler and reading through the reviews they need new management and servers, i would have loved to know what the food is like and so i can give a review of the food.... But hell . They were the worst place i have EVER EXPERIENCED. 330 AM IM STILL UPSET ABOUT IT. i mean i believe we at least deserve a refund?! Dont you?!</Text>< date>
